## Catch Performance Regressions in CI

The execs weren't happy about the deluge of negative reviews our game received due to my little performance bug.
They told me not to let it happen again, and when I asked how, they just told me not to do it again.
How am I supposed to manage thatâ€½

Luckily, I've found this awesome open source tool called Bencher.
There's a super generous free tier, so I can just use [Bencher Cloud](/) for my personal projects.
And at work where everything needs to be in our private cloud, I've started using [Bencher Self-Hosted](/docs/tutorial/docker/).

Bencher has a [built-in adapters](/docs/explanation/adapters/),
so it's easy to integrate into CI. After [following the Quick Start guide](/docs/tutorial/quick-start/),
I'm able to run my benchmarks and track them with Bencher.
