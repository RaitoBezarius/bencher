## Write FizzBuzz in Rust

<FizzBuzzRules />

<FizzBuzzRustCode />

- Create a `main` function
- Iterate from `1` to `100` inclusively.
- For each number, calculate the modulus (remainder after division) for both `3` and `5`.
- Pattern match on the two remainders.
    If the remainder is `0`, then the number is a multiple of the given factor.
- If the remainder is `0` for both `3` and `5` then print `FizzBuzz`.
- If the remainder is `0` for only `3` then print `Fizz`.
- If the remainder is `0` for only `5` then print `Buzz`.
- Otherwise, just print the number.
