### Follow Step-by-Step

In order to follow along with this set-by-step tutorial, you will need to [install Rust](https://rustup.rs/).

> 🐰 The source code for this post is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/bencherdev/bencher/tree/main/examples/rust/bench)

With Rust installed, you can then open a terminal window and enter: `cargo init game`

Then navigate into the newly created `game` directory.

<GameTree />

You should see a directory called `src` with file named `main.rs`:

<HelloWorld />

Replace its contents with the above FizzBuzz implementation. Then run `cargo run`.
The output should look like:

<FizzBuzzOutput />

> 🐰 Boom! You're cracking the coding interview!

A new `Cargo.lock` file should have been generated:

<GameLockTree />

Before going any further, it is important to discuss the differences between micro-benchmarking and macro-benchmarking.
