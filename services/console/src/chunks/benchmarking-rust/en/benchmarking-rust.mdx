## Benchmarking in Rust

The three popular options for benchmarking in Rust are:
[libtest bench](/learn/benchmarking/rust/libtest-bench/),
[Criterion](/learn/benchmarking/rust/criterion/), and
[Iai](/learn/benchmarking/rust/iai/).

libtest is Rust's built-in unit testing and benchmarking framework.
Though part of the Rust standard library, libtest bench is still considered unstable,
so it is only available on `nightly` compiler releases.
To work on the stable Rust compiler,
[a separate benchmarking harness](https://github.com/bluss/bencher)
needs to be used.
Neither is being actively developed, though.

The most popular benchmarking harness within the Rust ecosystem is Criterion.
It works on both stable and `nightly` Rust compiler releases,
and it has become the de facto standard within the Rust community.
Criterion is also much more feature-rich compared to libtest bench.

An experimental alternative to Criterion is Iai, from the same creator as Criterion.
However, it uses instruction counts instead of wall clock time:
CPU instructions, L1 accesses, L2 access and RAM accesses.
This allows for single-shot benchmarking since these metrics should stay nearly identical between runs.
