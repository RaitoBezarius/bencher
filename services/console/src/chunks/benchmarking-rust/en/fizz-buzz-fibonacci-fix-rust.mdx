## Fix FizzBuzzFibonacci in Rust

Let's take another look at that `is_fibonacci_number` function:

<IsFibonacciNumberRustCode />

Now that I'm thinking about performance, I do realize that I have an unnecessary, extra loop.
We can completely get rid of the `for i in 0..=n {}` loop and
just compare the `current` value to the given number (`n`) ðŸ¤¦

- Update your `is_fibonacci_number` function.
- Initialize our Fibonacci sequence starting with `0` and `1` as the `previous` and `current` numbers respectively.
- Iterate while the `current` number is less than the _given number_ `n`.
- Add the `previous` and `current` number to get the `next` number.
- Update the `previous` number to the `current` number.
- Update the `current` number to the `next` number.
- Once `current` is greater than or equal to the given number `n`, we will exit the loop.
- Check to see if the `current` number is equal to the given number `n` and return that result.
