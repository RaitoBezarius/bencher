### Refactor FizzBuzz

In order to test our FizzBuzz application, we need to decouple our logic from our program's `main` function.
Benchmark harnesses can't benchmark the `main` function. In order to do this, we need to make few changes.

Under `src`, create a new file named `lib.rs`:

<GameLibTree />

Add the following code to `lib.rs`:

<FizzBuzzRefactorLibCode />

- `play_game`: Takes in an unsigned integer `n`, calls `fizz_buzz` with that number, and if `print` is `true` prints the result.
- `fizz_buzz`: Takes in an unsigned integer `n` and performs the actual `Fizz`, `Buzz`, `FizzBuzz`, or number logic returning the result as a string.

Then update `main.rs` to look like this:

<FizzBuzzRefactorMainCode />

- `game::play_game`: Import `play_game` from the `game` crate we just created with `lib.rs`.
- `main`: The main entrypoint into our program that iterates through the numbers `1` to `100` inclusive and calls `play_game` for each number, with `print` set to `true`.
