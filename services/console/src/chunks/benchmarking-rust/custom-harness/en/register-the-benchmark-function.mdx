### Register the Benchmark Function

With our benchmark function written, we need to
create a `CustomBenchmark`
and register it with our benchmark collection using `inventory`.

<PlayGameRsInventorySubmit />

If we had more than one benchmark, we would repeat this same process:

1. Create a benchmark function.
2. Create a `CustomBenchmark` for the benchmark function.
3. Register the `CustomBenchmark` with the `inventory` collection.
