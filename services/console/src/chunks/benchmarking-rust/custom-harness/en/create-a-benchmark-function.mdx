### Create a Benchmark Function

Now, we can create a benchmark function that plays the FizzBuzzFibonacci game:

<PlayGameRsBenchPlayGame />

Going line by line:
- Create a benchmark function that matches the signature used in `CustomBenchmark`.
- Create a `dhat::Profiler` in testing mode,
  to collect results from our `dhat::Alloc` custom, global allocator.
- Run our `play_game` function inside of a “black box” so the compiler doesn’t optimize our code.
- Iterate from `1` to `100` inclusively.
- For each number, call `play_game`, with `print` set to `false`.
- Return our heap allocation stats as `dhat::HeapStats`.

> 🐰 We set `print` to `false` for the `play_game` function.
> This keeps `play_game` from printing to standard out.
> Parameterizing your library functions like this
> can make them more amenable to benchmarking.
> However, this does mean that we may not be benchmarking the library
> in exactly the same way that it is used in production.
>
> In this case, we have to ask ourselves:
> 1. Are the resources it takes to print to standard out something we care about?
> 2. Is printing to standard out a possible source of noise?
>
> For our example, we've gone with:
> 1. No, we don't care about printing to standard out.
> 2. Yes, it is a very likely source of noise.
>
> Therefore, we have omitted printing to standard out as a part of this benchmark.
> Benchmarking is hard, and there often isn't one right answer to questions like these.
