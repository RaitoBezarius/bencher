## Use a Custom Benchmarking Harness with `cargo bench`

To get `cargo bench` to not use libtest bench,
we need to add the following to our `Cargo.toml` file:

<CargoToml />

Unfortunately, we can't use the `#[bench]` attribute with our custom benchmarking harness.
[Maybe one day soon][github issue 2], but not today.
Instead, we have to create a separate `benches` directory to hold our benchmarks.
The `benches` directory is to benchmarks
what [the `tests` directory][tests directory] is to integration tests.
Each file inside of the `benches` directory is treated as a separate crate.
The crate being benchmarked must therefore be a library crate.
That is, it must have a `lib.rs` file.

For example, if we had a basic library crate named `game`
then we could add a custom benchmark file named `play_game` to the `benches` directory.
Our directory structure would look like this:

<FileTree />

Next, we need to let `cargo bench` know about our custom benchmark crate `play_game`.
So we update our `Cargo.toml` file:

<CargoTomlBenchName />
