### Create a Custom Benchmark Collector

To create a custom benchmarking harness,
we need a way identify and store our benchmark functions.
We will use a struct, aptly named `CustomBenchmark` to encapsulate each benchmark function.

<PlayGameRsCustomBenchmark />

A `CustomBenchmark` has a name and a benchmark function that returns `dhat::HeapStats` as its output.

Then we'll use the `inventory` crate to create a collection for all of our `CustomBenchmark`s:

<PlayGameRsInventoryCollect />
