## Create a Custom Benchmarking Harness

We are going to create a custom benchmarking harness inside of `benches/play_game.rs`.
This custom benchmarking harness is going to measure heap allocations
using [the `dhat-rs` crate][crates dhat].
`dhat-rs` is a fantastic tool for tracking heap allocations in Rust programs
create by Rust performance expert [Nicholas Nethercote][github nnethercote].
To help us manage our benchmark functions,
we will be using [the `inventory` crate][crates inventory]
by the astoundingly prolific [David Tolnay][github dtolnay].

Let's add `dhat-rs` and `inventory` to our `Cargo.toml` file as `dev-dependencies`:
