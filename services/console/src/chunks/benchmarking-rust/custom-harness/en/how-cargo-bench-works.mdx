## How `cargo bench` Works

Before building a custom benchmarking harness,
we need to understand how Rust benchmarks work.
For most Rust developers this means running [the `cargo bench` command][cargo bench].
The `cargo bench` command compiles and executes your benchmarks.
By default, `cargo bench` will try to use the built-in (but unstable) libtest bench harness.
libtest bench will then go through your code and run all functions annotated with the `#[bench]` attribute.
In order to use a custom benchmarking harness, we need to tell `cargo bench` to not use libtest bench.
