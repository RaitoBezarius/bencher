## Track Custom Benchmark Results

Most benchmark results are ephemeral.
They disappear as soon as your terminal reaches its scrollback limit.
Some benchmark harnesses let you cache results, but that's a lot of work to implement.
And even then, we could only store our results locally.
Lucky for us, our custom benchmarking harness will work with Bencher!
[Bencher][bencher] is a suite of continuous benchmarking tools
that allows us to track the results of our benchmarks over time
and catch performance regressions _before_ they make it to production.

Once you are all set up using [Bencher Cloud][quick start] or [Bencher Self-Hosted][docker quick start],
you can track the results from our custom benchmarking harness by running:

<BencherRun />
