## Write Code to Benchmark

Before we can write a performance test, we need to have some library code to benchmark.
For our example, we are going to play the FizzBuzzFibonacci game.

The rules for FizzBuzzFibonacci are as follows:

> Write a program that prints the integers from `1` to `100` (inclusive):
> - For multiples of three, print `Fizz`
> - For multiples of five, print `Buzz`
> - For multiples of both three and five, print `FizzBuzz`
> - For numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence, only print `Fibonacci`
> - For all others, print the number

This is what our implementation looks like in `src/lib.rs`:

<LibRs />
