With all that in mind, if you are looking to benchmark your code's wall clock time
then you should probably use Criterion.
If you are looking to [benchmark your code in CI][continuous benchmarking]
with shared runners then it may be worth checking out Iai.
Note though, Iai hasn't been update [in over 3 years][github iai].
So you might consider [using Iai-Callgrind][adapters iai callgrind] instead.

But what if you don't want to benchmark wall clock time or instruction counts?
What if you want to track some completely different benchmarkâ€½
Luckily, Rust makes it incredibly easy to create a custom benchmarking harness.
