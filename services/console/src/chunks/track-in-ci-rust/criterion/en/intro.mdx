Now that you have learned [how to benchmark Rust code with Criterion][learn criterion],
let's see how to track those benchmarks in CI.
[Continuous Benchmarking][continuous benchmarking] is the practice of running benchmarks on every changeset to ensure the changes do not introduce a performance regressions.
The easiest way to implement Continuous Benchmarking with Criterion benchmarks is to use Bencher.
