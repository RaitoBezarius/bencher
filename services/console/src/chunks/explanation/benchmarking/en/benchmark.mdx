## Benchmark
A Benchmark is a named performance regression test.
If the performance regression test is new to Bencher, then a Benchmark is automatically created.
Otherwise, the name of the performance regression test is used as the unique identifier for the Benchmark.

Be careful when changing the name of your performance regression tests.
You will need to manually rename the Benchmark in Bencher to match this new name.
Otherwise, the renamed performance regression test will be considered a new Benchmark.
This same word of caution also applies to _moving_ some performance regression tests.
Depending on the benchmark harness, the path to the performance regression test may be a part of its name.

The only exception to the above caveat is ignoring a Benchmark.
