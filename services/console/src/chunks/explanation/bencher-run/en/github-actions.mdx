### `--github-actions <GITHUB_TOKEN>`

<br />

Optional: Set the GitHub API authentication token (ie `--github-actions ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`).
When this option is set and `bencher run` is used in GitHub Actions as a part of a pull request,
then the results will be added to the pull request as a comment.
Otherwise, the results will be added to the commit as a GitHub Check comment.
The most convenient way to do this is the [GitHub Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).

> 🐰 If you are running inside of a Docker container within GitHub Action, you will need to pass in the following environment variables and mount the path specified by `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`:
> - `GITHUB_ACTIONS`
> - `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`
> - `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`
