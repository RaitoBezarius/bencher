## ðŸ¦€ Rust Iai

The Rust Iai Adapter (`rust_iai`) expects [Iai](https://github.com/bheisler/iai) output.
The `instructions`, `l1-accesses`, `l2-accesses`, `ram-accesses`, and `estimated-cycles` Measures are gathered.
Only the reported value (ie `value`) is available is available for these Measures.
Neither `lower_value` nor `upper_value` are collected.
The Measures for this adapter are not created by default for all projects.
However, when you use this adapter, these Measures will be automatically created for your Project.
