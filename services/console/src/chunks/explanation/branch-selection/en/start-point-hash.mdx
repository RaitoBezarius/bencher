### `--start-point-hash <HASH>`

<br />

Use the specified full Git hash as the [Start Point][start point] for the `branch` option.
This option requires [the `--start-point` option][start point option] to be set.

- If `branch` does not exist, it will be created from `start-point` at the specified hash.
- If `branch` does exist and both `start-point` and the specified hash are the same,
  then this option is ignored.
- If `branch` does exist and either the `start-point` or the specified hash are different,
  a new `branch` [Head][head] will be created from `start-point` at the specified hash.
- If `branch` does not exist and the `start-point` does not exist at the specified hash,
  then the `branch` will be created without any historical data.
- If `branch` does exist and the `start-point` does not exist at the specified hash,
  then this option is ignored.

If a new `branch` is created with a Start Point,
then all the most recent data and optionally Thresholds from the `start-point` at the specified hash are copied over.
See [the `--start-point-max-versions` option][start point max version option] and [the `--start-point-clone-thresholds` option][start point clone thresholds option] for more details.

For example, if `feature_branch` exists with its Start Point being the `main` Branch
at hash `32aea434d751648726097ed3ac760b57107edd8b`
then using `--branch feature_branch --start-point main --start-point-hash 68b12758509ca5e2b1e3983525625e532eb5f562`
would:

1. Remove the old `feature_branch` [Head][head]
2. Create a new `feature_branch` Head
3. Copy of all the most recent data from `main` at hash `68b12758509ca5e2b1e3983525625e532eb5f562` to the new `feature_branch` Head
4. `bencher run` would then proceed using the new `feature_branch` Head
