### `--start-point-reset`

<br />

Reset the specified `branch`.
When the [`--start-point`][start point option] option is set,
the `branch` will be reset to the specified Start Point.
This is useful to prevent drift in [Statistical Continuous Benchmarking][statistical continuous benchmarking] data.
The primary use case for `--start-point-reset` without specifying a Start Point
is [Relative Continuous Benchmarking][relative continuous benchmarking].

- If `branch` does not exit and no Start Point is specified, the `branch` will be created without any historical data.
- If `branch` does exist and no Start Point is specified,
  a new `branch` [Head][head] will be created without any historical data.
- If `branch` does not exist and a Start Point is specified,
  the `branch` will be created using the Start Point.
- If `branch` does exist and a Start Point is specified,
  a new `branch` [Head][head] will be created using the Start Point.

If a new `branch` is created with a Start Point,
then all the most recent data and optionally Thresholds from the `start-point` at the specified hash are copied over.
See [the `--start-point-max-versions` option][start point max version option] and [the `--start-point-clone-thresholds` option][start point clone thresholds option] for more details.

For example, if `feature_branch` exists without a Start Point
then using `--branch feature_branch --start-point-reset`
would:

1. Remove the old `feature_branch` [Head][head]
2. Create a new `feature_branch` Head with no historical data
3. `bencher run` would then proceed using the new `feature_branch` Head
