### `--start-point-max-versions <COUNT>`

<br />

Use the specified maximum number of historical branch versions to include
from the [Start Point][start point] for the `branch` option.
Any versions beyond this number will be omitted.
The default is `255` versions.
This option requires [the `--start-point` option][start point option] to be set.

For example, if `feature_branch` exists with its Start Point being the `main` Branch
and `main` has `300` versions,
then using `--branch feature_branch --start-point main --start-point-max-versions 100`
would only include the most recent `100` versions of `main` in `feature_branch`.
