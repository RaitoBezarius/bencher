### `--branch-reset`

<br />

Reset the specified `branch`.
When the [`--branch-start-point`][branch start point] option is set,
the `branch` will be reset to the specified Start Point.
This is useful to prevent drift in [Statistical Continuous Benchmarking][statistical continuous benchmarking] data.
The primary use case for `--branch-reset` without specifying a Start Point
is [Relative Continuous Benchmarking][relative continuous benchmarking].

- If `branch` does not exit and no Start Point is specified, the `branch` will be created without any historical data.
- If `branch` does exist and no Start Point is specified,
  the old version of `branch` will be both renamed and archived
  and a new `branch` will be created without any historical data.
- If `branch` does not exist and a Start Point is specified,
  the `branch` will be created using the Start Point.
- If `branch` does exist and a Start Point is specified,
  the old version of `branch` will be both renamed and archived
  and a new `branch` will be created using the Start Point.

If a new `branch` is created with a Start Point,
then all the data and Thresholds from the specified Start Point are copied over.
Otherwise, the `branch` will be created without any historical data.

For example, if `feature_branch` exists without a Start Point
then using `--branch feature_branch --branch-reset`
would:

1. Rename the old `feature_branch` to `feature_branch@detached` and archive it
2. Create a new Branch named `feature_branch`
3. `bencher run` would proceed using the new `feature_branch`
