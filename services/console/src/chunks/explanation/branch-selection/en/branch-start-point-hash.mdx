### `--branch-start-point-hash <HASH>`

<br />

Use the specified full Git hash as the [Start Point][start point] for the `branch` option.
This option requires the [`--branch-start-point`][branch start point] option to be set.

- If `branch` does not exist, it will be created from `branch-start-point` at the specified hash.
- If `branch` does exist and both `branch-start-point` and the specified hash are the same,
  then this option is ignored.
- If `branch` already exists and either the `branch-start-point` or the specified hash are different,
  the old version of `branch` will be renamed
  and a new `branch` will be created from `branch-start-point` at the specified hash.
- If `branch` does not exist and the `branch-start-point` does not exist at the specified hash,
  then the `branch` will be created without any historical data.
- If `branch` does exist and the `branch-start-point` does not exist at the specified hash,
  then this option is ignored.

If a new `branch` is created with a Start Point,
then all the data and Thresholds from the `branch-start-point` at the specified hash are copied over.

For example, if `feature_branch` exists with its Start Point being the `main` Branch
at hash `32aea434d751648726097ed3ac760b57107edd8b`
then using `--branch feature_branch --branch-start-point main --branch-start-point-hash 68b12758509ca5e2b1e3983525625e532eb5f562`
would:

1. Rename the old `feature_branch` to `feature_branch@main/hash/32aea434d751648726097ed3ac760b57107edd8b`
2. Create a new Branch named `feature_branch`
3. Copy of all the data and Thresholds from `main` at hash `68b12758509ca5e2b1e3983525625e532eb5f562` to the new `feature_branch`
4. `bencher run` would proceed using the new `feature_branch`
