## `--threshold-min-sample-size <SAMPLE_SIZE>`

<br />

Optionally specify the minimum number of [Metrics][metric] required to run a Test.
If this minimum is not met, the Test will not run.
The specified sample size must be greater than or equal to `2`.
If [the `--threshold-max-sample-size` option][threshold max sample size option] is also set,
then the specified sample size must be less than or equal to `--threshold-max-sample-size`.
This option cannot be used with [the Static (`static`) Test][static].

For example to use a Threshold with a minimum sample size of `10`,
you could write `--threshold-min-sample-size 10`.
If there were fewer than `10` Metrics, the Test would not run.
Conversely, if there were `10` or more Metrics, the Test would run.
