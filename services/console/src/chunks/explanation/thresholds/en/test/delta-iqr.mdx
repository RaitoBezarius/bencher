### Delta Interquartile Range

A Delta Interquartile Range Test (`delta_iqr`) measures how many multiples of the average percentage change (Δ) [interquartile range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range) (IQR)
a new Metric is above or below the median of your historical Metrics.
If a new Metric is below a certain multiple of the ΔIQR from the median (Lower Boundary)
or above a certain multiple of the ΔIQR from the median (Upper Boundary) of your historical Metrics an Alert is generated.
Either a Lower Boundary, Upper Boundary, or both must be set.

- #### Delta Interquartile Range Lower Boundary
  - A Delta Interquartile Range Test Lower Boundary can be any multiplier greater than or equal to zero (ex: use `2.0` for `2x`).
It is used when a smaller value would indicate a performance regression.
  - For example, if you had a Delta Interquartile Range Test with a Lower Boundary set to `2.0`
and your historical Metrics had a median of `100`, an interquartile range of `10`, and an average delta interquartile range of `0.2` (`20%`)
the Lower Boundary Limit would be `60` and
any value less than `60` would generate an Alert.
- #### Delta Interquartile Range Upper Boundary
  - A Delta Interquartile Range Test Upper Boundary can be any multiplier greater than or equal to zero (ex: use `2.0` for `2x`).
It is used when a greater value would indicate a performance regression.
  - For example, if you had a Delta Interquartile Range Test with an Upper Boundary set to `2.0`
and your historical Metrics had a median of `100`, an interquartile range of `10`, and an average delta interquartile range of `0.2` (`20%`)
the Upper Boundary Limit would be `140` and
any value greater than `140` would generate an Alert.
