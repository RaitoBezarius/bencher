### t-test

A t-test Test (`t_test`) measures the [confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval) (CI) for how likely it is that
a new Metric is above or below the mean of your historical Metrics using a [Student's t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test).

t-test Tests work best when:
- There are no extreme differences between benchmark runs
- Benchmark runs are totally independent of one another
- The number of iterations for a single benchmark run is less than 10% of the historical Metrics

For t-test Tests, confidence intervals are expressed as a decimal confidence percentage.
If a new Metric is below a certain left-side confidence percentage (Lower Boundary)
or above a certain right-side confidence percentage (Upper Boundary) for your historical Metrics an Alert is generated.
Either a Lower Boundary, Upper Boundary, or both must be set.

- #### t-test Lower Boundary
  - A t-test Test Lower Boundary can be any positive decimal between `0.5` and `1.0`.
Where `0.5` represents the mean and `1.0` represents all possible left-side values (-∞).
It is used when a smaller value would indicate a performance regression.
  - For example, if you used a t-test Test with a Lower Boundary of `0.977`
and you had `25` historical Metrics with a mean of `100` and a standard deviation of `10`,
the Lower Boundary Limit would be `78.96` and
any value less than `78.96` would generate an Alert.
- #### t-test Upper Boundary
  - A t-test Test Upper Boundary can be any positive decimal between `0.5` and `1.0`.
Where `0.5` represents the mean and `1.0` represents all possible right-side values (∞).
It is used when a greater value would indicate a performance regression.
  - For example, if you used a t-test Test with an Upper Boundary of `0.977`
and you had `25` historical Metrics with a mean of `100` and a standard deviation of `10`,
the Upper Boundary Limit would be `121.04` and
any value greater than `121.04` would generate an Alert.
