## `--threshold-measure <MEASURE>`

<br />

Use the specified [Measure][measure] name, slug, or UUID for a Threshold.
If the value specified is a name or slug and the Measure does not already exist, it will be created for you.
However, if the value specified is a UUID then the Measure must already exist.

For example, to use a Threshold for the Latency Measure,
you could write `--threshold-measure latency`.
