## Multiple Thresholds

It is possible to create multiple Thresholds with the same
<code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> invocation.
When specifying multiple Thresholds, all of the same options must be used for each Threshold.
To ignore an option for a specific Threshold, use an underscore (`_`).

For example, if you only want to use two Thresholds,
one for the Latency Measure and one for the Throughput Measure
then you would likely want to set an Upper Boundary for the Latency Measure
and a Lower Boundary for the Throughput Measure.
Therefore, you would use `--threshold-lower-boundary _` for the Latency Measure
and `--threshold-upper-boundary _` for the Throughput Measure.
You could write something this:

<MultipleThresholdsCode />
