Depending on your use case, you can set up [Continuous Benchmarking][continuous benchmarking] in GitLab CI/CD for your:

- [Target Branch](#target-branch)
- [Merge Requests](#merge-requests)

Make sure you have [created an API token][created an api token]
and set it as a masked variable named `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` before continuing on!
Navigate to `Your Repo -> Settings -> CI/CD -> Variables -> Expand -> Add variable`.
The variable key should be `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` and the variable value should be your API token.
Check both the `Protect variable` and `Mask variable` boxes.
