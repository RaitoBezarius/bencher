### Linux, Mac, & Unix
For Linux, Mac, and other Unix-like systems run the following in your terminal:

<CliUnixScript />

There is an optional `BENCHER_VERSION` environment variable to specify an exact version of the Bencher CLI to use.
Otherwise, it will default to using the latest CLI version.
Specify an exact version if and only if using [Bencher *Self-Hosted*][bencher self hosted].
Do __not__ specify an exact version if using Bencher *Cloud* as there are still occasional breaking changes.

<CliUnixScriptVersion />

Alternatively, Bencher Self-Hosted users can use the install script from their own self-hosted instance
to make sure they are always installing the correct version of the `bencher` CLI.
This has the added benefit of not requiring a code change to your CI configuration when upgrading your Bencher Self-Hosted instance.
For example, if your Bencher Self-Hosted Console is running at `https://bencher.example.com`,
you could run the following:

<CliUnixSelfHosted />

### Windows
For Windows systems run the following in a _PowerShell_ terminal:

<CliWindowsScript />

There is an optional `BENCHER_VERSION` environment variable to specify an exact version of the Bencher CLI to use.
Otherwise, it will default to using the latest CLI version.
Specify an exact version if and only if using [Bencher *Self-Hosted*][bencher self hosted].
Do __not__ specify an exact version if using Bencher *Cloud* as there are still occasional breaking changes.

<CliWindowsScriptVersion />

Alternatively, Bencher Self-Hosted users can use the install script from their own self-hosted instance
to make sure they are always installing the correct version of the `bencher` CLI.

For example, if your Bencher Self-Hosted Console is running at `https://bencher.example.com`,
you could run the following:

<CliWindowsSelfHosted />
