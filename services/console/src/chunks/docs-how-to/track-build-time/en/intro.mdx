Bencher supports [the most popular benchmarking harnesses][adapters] out-of-the-box.
Sometimes though, you want to measure how long it takes to build your deliverables themselves,
such as the compile time of an executable.
Lucky for you, Bencher also supports tracking build times.
The easiest way to track build times is to use the
<code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand
with the `--build-time` flag.
Under the hood, <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code>
outputs the results as [Bencher Metric Format (BMF) JSON][bmf].
It is therefore good practice to explicitly use [the `json` adapter][json adapter].
