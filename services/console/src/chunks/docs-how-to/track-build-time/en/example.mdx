If you had a script located at `./my_build_script.sh` that built your binary,
then you could track the build time of this binary with
<code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code>
and [the `json` adapter][json adapter].
The `--build-time` flag requires [a benchmark command][bencher run].

<ShellExample />

The generated BMF JSON would look like this,
if your build script took `87.0` seconds to complete:

<ShellJsonExample />

Note that the [Benchmark][benchmark] name is `/bin/sh -c ./my_build_script.sh`.
This is because our command is only a single argument, so
<code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code>
defaults to the shell form for execution.
Alternatively, if you would like to force the use of the exec form,
you can either provide multiple arguments or use the `--exec` flag.

<ExecExample />

If this exec form build took `86.98` seconds,
then the generated BMF JSON would look like this:

<ExecJsonExample />

Now, the [Benchmark][benchmark] name is simply `./my_build_script.sh`.
The `./my_build_script.sh` object contains the `build-time` key.
`build-time` is the slug for the built-in Build Time [Measure][measure].
The Build Time Measure is not created by default for all Projects.
However, when you use the Build Time Measure,
it will be automatically created for your Project.
The Build Time Measure object contains a [Metric][metric]
with the build time `value` in seconds, `87.0` and `86.98` in our examples.

The Build Time will always be rounded to the nearest two decimal places.
That is, it will _never_ be a long decimal like `42.666666`.
