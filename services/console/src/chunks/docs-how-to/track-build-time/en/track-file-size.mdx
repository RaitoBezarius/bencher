## Track File Size

You may want to [track the file size][track file size] of your deliverables,
in addition to tracking how long it takes to build them.
<code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code>
supports tracking both build times and file sizes.

If the output of your `./my_build_script.sh` build script
was a binary at the path `./path/to/my_binary`,
then you could track both the compile time and the binary size with this command:

<FileSize />

If `my_binary` had a size of `42` bytes,
the generated BMF JSON would look like this:

<FileSizeJson />
