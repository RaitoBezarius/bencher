## Multiple Measures

In [Bencher Metric Format (BMF) JSON][bmf]
the [Benchmark][benchmark] object can contain multiple [Measure][measure] names, slugs, or UUIDs as keys.
If the value specified is a name or slug and the Measure does not already exist, it will be created for you.
However, if the value specified is a UUID then the Measure must already exist.
Each Measure object must contain a [Metric][metric] with up to three values:
`value`, `lower_value`, and `upper_value`.
The `lower_value` and `upper_value` values are optional.

This is an example of BMF JSON with multiple Measures:

<BmfMultiExample />

In this example, the `latency` Measure object contains the following values:

- A `value` of `88.0`
- A `lower_value` of `87.42`
- An `upper_value` of `88.88`

And the `throughput` Measure object contains the following values:

- A `value` of `5.55`
- A `lower_value` of `3.14`
- An `upper_value` of `6.30`

You can use [the `bencher mock` CLI subcommand][bencher mock]
with [the `--measure` option][measure option]
to generate mock BMF data with multiple Measures.
We will use it as a placeholder for your own custom benchmark runner.
Using <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code>
and [the `json` adapter][json adapter]
we can track our benchmarks with multiple Measures with the following command:
