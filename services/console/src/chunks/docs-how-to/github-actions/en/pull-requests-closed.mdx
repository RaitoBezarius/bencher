To clean up the PR branch after its PR is closed,
you can create a separate workflow to run `on` `pull_request` events with the `closed` type.
This workflow will archive the PR branch using the `bencher archive` command.

<PullRequestsClosedCode />

1. Create a GitHub Actions `workflow` file.
   (ex: `.github/workflows/pr_benchmarks_closed.yml`)
2. Run on `pull_request` events:
   - `closed` - A pull request was closed.

   See the [GitHub Actions `on` documentation][github actions on]
   and [GitHub Actions `pull_request` documentation][github action pull_request] for a full overview.
   (ex: `on: pull_request: types: [closed]`)
3. Create a GitHub Actions `job`.
   (ex: `jobs: archive_pr_branch`)
4. Run on `pull_request` events if and only if the pull request is from the same repository.
   ⚠️ DO NOT REMOVE THIS LINE!
   For handling Fork PRs see [Pull Requests from Forks][pull requests from forks] below.
   (ex: `if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository`)
5. Set the type of machine the job will run on.
   See the [GitHub Actions `runs-on` documentation][github actions runs-on]
   for a full overview.
   (ex: `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`)
6. Checkout the PR branch source code.
   (ex: `uses: actions/checkout@v4`)
7. Install the Bencher CLI using [the GitHub Action][bencher cli github action].
   (ex: `uses: bencherdev/bencher@main`)
8.  Use the `bencher archive` CLI subcommand to archive the PR branch.
   (ex: `bencher archive`)
9.  Set the `--project` option to the Project slug.
    See [the `--project` docs][project option] for more details.
    (ex: `--project project-abc4567-wxyz123456789`)
10. Set the `--token` option to the `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` **Repository** secret.
    See [the `--token` docs][token option] for more details.
    (ex: `--token '${{ secrets.BENCHER_API_TOKEN }}'`)
11. Set the `--branch` option to the PR branch name
    using [the GitHub Actions `GITHUB_HEAD_REF` default environment variable][github default environment variables].
    (ex: `--branch "$GITHUB_HEAD_REF"`)
