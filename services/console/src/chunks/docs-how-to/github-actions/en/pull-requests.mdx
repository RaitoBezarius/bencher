## Pull Requests

In order to catch performance regression in Pull Requests, you will need to run your benchmarks on PRs.
If you only expect to have PRs from branches within the **same** repository
then you can simply create another workflow to run `on` `pull_request` events from the same repository.

> ⚠️ This solution only works if all PRs are from the **same** repository!
> See [Pull Requests from Forks][pull requests from forks] below.

<PullRequestsCode />

1. Create a GitHub Actions `workflow` file.
   (ex: `.github/workflows/pr_benchmarks.yml`)
2. Run on `pull_request` events:
   - `opened` - A pull request was created.
   - `reopened` - A previously closed pull request was reopened.
   - `edited` - The title or body of a pull request was edited, or the base branch of a pull request was changed.
   - `synchronize` - A pull request's head branch was updated.
   For example, the head branch was updated from the base branch or new commits were pushed to the head branch.

   See the [GitHub Actions `on` documentation][github actions on]
   and [GitHub Actions `pull_request` documentation][github action pull_request] for a full overview.
   (ex: `on: pull_request: types: [opened, reopened, edited, synchronize]`)
3. Create a GitHub Actions `job`.
   (ex: `jobs: benchmark_pr_branch`)
4. Run on `pull_request` events if and only if the pull request is from the same repository.
   ⚠️ DO NOT REMOVE THIS LINE!
   For handling Fork PRs see [Pull Requests from Forks][pull requests from forks] below.
   (ex: `if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository`)
5. Set [the permissions for the `GITHUB_TOKEN`][github token permissions]
   to `write` for `pull-requests`.
   Depending on your GitHub settings, this may not be required.
   But for all organizations and personal repos
   [created after 02 Feb 2023][github token read only],
   this is the default behavior.
   See [the GitHub documentation][github token permissions security]
   for a full overview.
   (ex: `permissions: pull-requests: write`)
6. Set the type of machine the job will run on.
   See the [GitHub Actions `runs-on` documentation][github actions runs-on]
   for a full overview.
   (ex: `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`)
7. Checkout the PR branch source code.
   (ex: `uses: actions/checkout@v4`)
8. Install the Bencher CLI using [the GitHub Action][bencher cli github action].
   (ex: `uses: bencherdev/bencher@main`)
9. Use the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand
   to run your pull request branch benchmarks.
   See [the `bencher run` CLI subcommand][bencher run] for a full overview.
   (ex: `bencher run`)
10. Set the `--project` option to the Project slug.
    See [the `--project` docs][project option] for more details.
    (ex: `--project project-abc4567-wxyz123456789`)
11. Set the `--token` option to the `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` **Repository** secret.
    See [the `--token` docs][token option] for more details.
    (ex: `--token '${{ secrets.BENCHER_API_TOKEN }}'`)
12. Set the `--branch` option to the PR branch name
    using [the GitHub Actions `GITHUB_HEAD_REF` default environment variable][github default environment variables].
    See [the `--branch` docs][branch option] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--branch "$GITHUB_HEAD_REF"`)
13. Set the Start Point for the PR Branch:
    1. Set the `--start-point` option to the PR Branch start point
    using [the GitHub Actions `GITHUB_BASE_REF` default environment variable][github default environment variables].
    See [the `--start-point` docs][start point] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--start-point "$GITHUB_BASE_REF"`)
    2. Set the `--start-point-hash` option to the PR Branch start point `git` hash
    using [the GitHub Actions `pull_request` event][github action pull_request].
    See [the `--start-point-hash` docs][start point hash] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--start-point-hash '${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}'`)
    3. Set the `--start-point-clone-thresholds` flag to clone the Thresholds from the start point.
    See [the `--start-point-clone-thresholds` docs][start point clone thresholds] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--start-point-clone-thresholds`)
    4. Set the `--start-point-reset` flag to always reset the PR Branch to the start point.
    This will prevent benchmark data drift.
    See [the `--start-point-reset` docs][start point reset] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--start-point-reset`)
14. Set the `--testbed` option to the Testbed name.
    This should likely match the machine selected in `runs-on`.
    See [the `--tested` docs][testbed option] for more details.
    (ex: `--testbed ubuntu-latest`)
15. Set the `--err` flag to fail the command if an Alert is generated.
   See [the `--err` docs][alert err] for a full overview.
   (ex: `--err`)
16. Set the `--adapter` option to [Bencher Metric Format JSON (`json`)][bmf] that is generated by <code><a href="/docs/reference/bencher-metric-format/#bencher-mock">bencher mock</a></code>.
   See [benchmark harness adapters][adapter json] for a full overview.
   (ex: `--adapter json`)
17. Set the `--github-actions` option to the GitHub API authentication token to post results as a comment on the Pull Request using
    [the GitHub Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable][github token].
    See [the `--github-actions` docs][github actions option] for more details.
    (ex: `--github-actions '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'`)
18. Specify the benchmark command arguments.
    See [benchmark command][command argument] for a full overview.
    (ex: `bencher mock`)
