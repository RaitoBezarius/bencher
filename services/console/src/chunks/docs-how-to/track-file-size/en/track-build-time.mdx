## Track Build Time

You may want to [track the build time][track build time] of your deliverables,
in addition to tracking their file size.
<code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code>
supports tracking both file sizes and build times.

You could track both the binary size and the compile time for `my_binary` with this command:

<BuildTime />

If your build script took `87.0` seconds to complete,
the generated BMF JSON would look like this:

<BuildTimeJson />
