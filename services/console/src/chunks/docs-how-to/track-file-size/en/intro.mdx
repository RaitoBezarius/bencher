Bencher supports [the most popular benchmarking harnesses][adapters] out-of-the-box.
Sometimes though, you want to measure the size of your deliverables themselves,
such as the binary size of your executable.
Lucky for you, Bencher also supports tracking file size.
The easiest way to track file size is to use the
<code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand
with the `--file-size` option.
The `--file-size` option expects a file path to the file who's size will be measured.
Under the hood, <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code>
outputs the results as [Bencher Metric Format (BMF) JSON][bmf].
It is therefore good practice to explicitly use [the `json` adapter][json adapter].
