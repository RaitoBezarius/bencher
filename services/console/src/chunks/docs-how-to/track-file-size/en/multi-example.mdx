The File Size will always be a whole byte increment.
That is, it will _never_ have a decimal like `42.5`.
However, BMF JSON needs to support a wide range of possible values,
so it uses floats instead of integers.

If you want to track the size of multiple files,
you can simply use the `--file-size` option multiple times in the same
<code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> command.
For example, you could track both `my_binary` and a Windows executable version, `my_binary.exe`.

The generated BMF JSON would look like this if `my_binary.exe` had a size of `48` bytes:
