## `unclaimed` Projects

Bencher allows you to track benchmarks results without creating an account.
When you invoke the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand
without setting [the `--token` option][token option],
Bencher will create a new `unclaimed` [on-the-fly][on the fly projects] Project
for your benchmark results.
If you followed the [Quick Start][quick start] or [Self-Hosted Quick Start][self-hosted quick start] tutorials,
you were taking advantage of this functionality.

Anyone can view and post benchmark results to an `unclaimed` Project.
In order to claim an `unclaimed` Project, you will need to create an account.
If you follow the `Claim this project` signup link at the end of your
<code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> output,
you will automatically claim the Project when your account is created.

If you already have a Bencher account,
then you can navigate to the Project's [public Perf Page][bencher perf]
and click the `Claim this project` button at the top of the page.
Similarly, if you already have an API token,
you can use the API token with the [the `--token` option][token option]
the next time you invoke <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code>
to claim the Project.

> 🐰 IMPORTANT: Once a Project is `claimed`, it cannot be posted to anonymously.
> You **must** use an API token with the [the `--token` option][token option].
