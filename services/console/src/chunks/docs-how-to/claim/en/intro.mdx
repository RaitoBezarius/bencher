Most benchmark results are ephemeral.
They disappear as soon as your terminal reaches its scrollback limit.
Some benchmark harnesses let you cache results, but most only do so locally.
Bencher allows you to track your benchmarks from both local and CI runs and compare the results,
while still using [your favorite benchmark harness][adapters].
Bencher has a few features that make it easy to track your local benchmark results
that need to be taken into consideration when transitioning to [track benchmarks in CI][track benchmarks].
