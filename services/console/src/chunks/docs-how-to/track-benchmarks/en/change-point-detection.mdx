## Change Point Detection

Change Point Detection uses a [change point algorithm][change detection] to evaluate a large window of recent results.
This allows the algorithm to ignore outliers as noise and produce fewer false positives.
Even though Change Point Detection is considered [continuous benchmarking][continuous benchmarking],
it does not allow you to detect performance regression in CI.
That is, you cannot detect a performance regression before a feature branch merges.
This is sometimes referred to as "out-of-band" detection.

For example, if you have a benchmark `bench_my_critical_path`,
and it had the following historical latencies: `5 ms`, `6 ms`, `5 ms`, `5ms`, `7ms`.

If the next benchmark result was `11 ms` then a Statistical Continuous Benchmarking threshold
and Change Point Detection algorithm would interpret things very differently.
The threshold would likely be exceeded and an alert would be generated.
If this benchmark run was tied to a pull request,
the build would likely be set to fail due to this alert.
However, the change point algorithm wouldn't do anything... yet.
If the next run things dropped back down to `5 ms` then it would probably not generate an alert.
Conversely, if the next run or two resulted in `10 ms` and `12 ms`,
only then would the change point algorithm trigger an alert.
