## Benchmarking in C++

The two popular options for benchmarking in C++ are:
[Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark)
and
[Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

Google Benchmark is a robust and versatile benchmarking library for C++ that allows developers to measure the performance of their code with high precision. One of its key benefits is its ease of integration into existing projects, especially those that already use [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest). Google Benchmark provides detailed performance metrics, including the ability to measure CPU time, wall time, and memory usage. It supports a wide range of benchmarking scenarios, from simple function benchmarks to complex, parameterized tests.

Catch2 is a modern, header-only testing framework for C++ that simplifies the process of writing and running tests. One of its primary benefits is its ease of use, with a syntax that is both intuitive and expressive, allowing developers to write tests quickly and clearly. Catch2 supports a wide range of test types, including unit tests, integration tests, behavior-driven development (BDD) style tests, and basic micro-benchmarking features.
