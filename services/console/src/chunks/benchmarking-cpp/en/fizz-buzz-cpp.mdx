## Write FizzBuzz in C++

<FizzBuzzCode />

- Iterate from `1` to `100`, incrementing after every iteration.
- For each number, calculate the modulus (remainder after division).
- If the remainder is `0`, then the number is a multiple of the given factor.
  - If the remainder is `0` for `15`, then print `FizzBuzz`.
  - If the remainder is `0` for `3`, then print `Fizz`.
  - If the remainder is `0` for `5` ,then print `Buzz`.
- Otherwise, just print the number.
