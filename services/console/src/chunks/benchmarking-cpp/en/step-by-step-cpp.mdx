### Follow Step-by-Step

In order to follow along with this set-by-step tutorial, you will need to [install `git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [install `cmake`](https://cmake.org/download/#latest), and [install the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) `g++`](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/).

> 🐰 The source code for this post is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/bencherdev/bencher/tree/main/examples/cpp/google_benchmark).

Create a C++ file named `game.cpp`,
and set its contents to the above FizzBuzz implementation.

Use `g++` to build an executable named `game` and then run it.
The output should look like:

<FizzBuzzOutput />

> 🐰 Boom! You're cracking the coding interview!

Before going any further, it is important to discuss the differences between micro-benchmarking and macro-benchmarking.
