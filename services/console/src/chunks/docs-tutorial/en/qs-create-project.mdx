## Create a Project

Now that we have a user account and API token, we can create a Project.
First, we need to know which Organization our new Project will belong to.

Run: `bencher org list`

You should see something like:

<QSOrgLsOutput />

Your output should be slightly different than the above:
- The `uuid` is pseudorandom
- The `name` and `slug` will be based on your username
- The `created` and `modified` timestamps will be from when you just signed up

<br />

We can now create a new Project inside of your Organization.
Substitute your Organization `slug` for the `organization` argument (ie `YOUR_ORG_SLUG`) in the command below.

Run: `bencher project create YOUR_ORG_SLUG --name "Save Walter White" --url http://www.savewalterwhite.com`

You should see something like:

<QSProjectCreateOutput />

Again, your output should be slightly different than the above.
It's just important that this command works.
Take note of the Project `slug` field (ie `save-walter-white-1234abcd`).
