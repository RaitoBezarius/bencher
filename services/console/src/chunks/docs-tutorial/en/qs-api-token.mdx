## Create an API Token

In order to use the Bencher API, you will need to create an API token.
Navigate to the Bencher Console.
Hover over your name in top right corner.
A dropdown menu should appear. Select `Tokens`.
Once on the API Tokens page, click the `‚ûï Add` button.

{ props.children }
<br />

Once you have created your new API token, you will need to copy it to your clipboard.
In the terminal you plan to work in, export the API token as an environment variable.

On Linux, Mac, and other Unix-like systems run: `export BENCHER_API_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN`

On Windows run: `$env:BENCHER_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_TOKEN"`

If you then run `echo $BENCHER_API_TOKEN` or `Write-Output $env:BENCHER_API_TOKEN` respectively.

You should see:

```
$ echo $BENCHER_API_TOKEN
YOUR_TOKEN
```

<br />

> üê∞ Note: If you move to a different terminal, you will need to export the API token again.
