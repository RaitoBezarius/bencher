## Run Bencher UI & API Servers

With `docker` installed, we can now run the UI and API servers.

Run: `bencher up`

You should see something like:

<DockerBencherUpOutput />

Again, it is okay if your output is different. It's just important that this command works.

> Try running: `docker logout ghcr.io`

> 🐰 On Windows, if you get an error saying:
> `image operating system "linux" cannot be used on this platform: operating system is not supported`
> Try running: `& 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchLinuxEngine`

### Bencher API Server Logs

Because we haven't [set up email/SMTP on the API server](/docs/reference/server-config/#smtp) yet,
the confirmation codes you will receive later in the tutorial are going to be in the server logs, as shown above.
That is, the authentication credentials are going to be shown in the output of `bencher up`.
