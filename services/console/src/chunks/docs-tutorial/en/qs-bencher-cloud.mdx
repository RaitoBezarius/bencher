## Create a Bencher Cloud Account

Bencher is open source and self-hostable.
If you are interested in self-hosting, check out the [Bencher Docker tutorial](/docs/tutorial/docker/).
For this tutorial though, we are going to use Bencher Cloud.


<h3><a id="sign-up-bencher-cloud" href="/auth/signup" target="_blank">Sign up for Bencher Cloud</a></h3>
<br />

Once you have created an account, you will need to confirm your email address.
Check your email for a confirmation link.
After that, you should be logged in to Bencher Cloud.
