## Install Docker

In order to run the UI and API servers in this tutorial you will need to have `docker` installed.
Check to see if you have `docker` installed.

Run: `docker --version`

You should see something like:

<DockerVersionOutput />

It is okay if your version number is different. It's just important that this command works.
If not follow the [instructions for installing `docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
