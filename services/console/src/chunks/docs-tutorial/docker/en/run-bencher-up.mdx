## Run `bencher up`

With `docker` and the `bencher` CLI installed, you can now run the Console and API servers
with [the `bencher up` CLI subcommand][bencher up].
Run:

<TerminalCommand code="bencher up" />

You should see something like:

<BencherUpOutput />

Again, it is okay if your output is different. It's just important that this command works.
