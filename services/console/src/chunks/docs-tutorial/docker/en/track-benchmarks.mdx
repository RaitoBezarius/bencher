## Track your Benchmarks

We are now ready to track some benchmark results!
To do so, we will use [the `bencher run` CLI subcommand][bencher run]
to run your benchmarks and collect the results.

Run: <BencherRun isConsole={false} />

You may need to modify the benchmark command to match your setup.
If you don't have any benchmarks yet, you can just use [the `bencher mock` subcommand][bencher mock] as your benchmark command to generate some mock data.
If everything works as expected, the end of the output should look something like this:

<BencherRunOutput />

You can now view the results for each of your benchmarks in the browser.
Click or copy and paste the links from `View results`.
To [claim the project][claim project], click or copy and pase the `Claim this project` link into your browser.
