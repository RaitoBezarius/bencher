## Refactor FizzBuzz

In order to test our FizzBuzz application,
we need to decouple our logic from our program's default control flow.
Benchmark harnesses can't benchmark the default control flow.
In order to do this, we need to make few changes.

Let's refactor our FizzBuzz logic into a couple of function:

<FizzBuzzRefactorCode />

- `play_game`: Takes in an integer `n`, calls `fizz_buzz` with that number, and if `should_print` is `true` prints the result.
- `fizz_buzz`: Takes in an unsigned integer `n` and performs the actual `Fizz`, `Buzz`, `FizzBuzz`, or number logic returning the result as a string.

Then update then default control flow to look like this:

<PlayGameCode />

The default control flow for our program iterates through the numbers `1` to `100` inclusive and calls `play_game` for each number, with `print` set to `true`Refactor FizzBuzz.
