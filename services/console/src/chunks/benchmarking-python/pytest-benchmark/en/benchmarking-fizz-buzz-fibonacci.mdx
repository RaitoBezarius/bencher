## Benchmarking FizzBuzzFibonacci

Now we can rerun our benchmark:

<PytestGameFibonacciOutput />

Scrolling back through our terminal history,
we can make an eyeball comparison between the performance of our FizzBuzz and FizzBuzzFibonacci games: `10.8307 us` vs `735.5682 us`.
Your numbers will be a little different than mine.
However, the difference between the two games is likely in the 50x range.
That seems good to me! Especially for adding a feature as fancy sounding as _Fibonacci_ to our game.
The kids will love it!
