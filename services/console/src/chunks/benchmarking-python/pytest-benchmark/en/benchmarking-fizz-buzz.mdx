## Benchmarking FizzBuzz

In order to benchmark our code, we need to create a test function that runs our benchmark.
At the bottom of `game.py` add the following code:

<TestGameCode />

- Create a function named `test_game` that takes in a `pytest-benchmark` `benchmark` fixture.
- Create a `run_game` function that iterate from `1` to `100` inclusively.
  - For each number, call `play_game`, with `should_print` set to `false`.
- Pass the `run_game` function the the `benchmark` runner.

Now we need to configure our project to run our benchmarks.

Create a new virtual environment with `pipenv`:

<PipenvShellOutput />

Install `pytest-benchmark` inside of that new `pipenv` environment:

<PipenvInstallOutput />

Now we're ready to benchmark our code, run `pytest game.py`:

<PytestGameOutput />

> üê∞ Lettuce turnip the beet! We've got our first benchmark metrics!

Finally, we can rest our weary developer heads...
Just kidding, our users want a new feature!
