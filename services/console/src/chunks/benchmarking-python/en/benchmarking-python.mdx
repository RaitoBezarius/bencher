## Benchmarking in Python

The two popular options for benchmarking in Python are:
[pytest-benchmark](https://pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.io)
and
[airspeed velocity (asv)](https://github.com/airspeed-velocity/asv).

`pytest-benchmark` is a powerful benchmarking tool
integrated with the popular [`pytest` testing framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).
It allows developers to measure and compare the performance of their code by running benchmarks alongside their unit tests.
Users can easily compare their benchmark results locally
and export their results in various formats, such as JSON.

`airspeed velocity (asv)` is another advanced benchmarking tool in the Python ecosystem.
One of the key benefits of `asv` is its ability to generate detailed and interactive HTML reports,
which make it easy to visualize performance trends and identify regressions.
Additionally, `asv` supports [Relative Continuous Benchmarking](/docs/how-to/track-benchmarks/#relative-continuous-benchmarking) out of the box.
