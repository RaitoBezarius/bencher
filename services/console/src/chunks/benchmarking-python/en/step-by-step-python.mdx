### Follow Step-by-Step

In order to follow along with this set-by-step tutorial, you will need to [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [install `pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html).

> 🐰 The source code for this post is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/bencherdev/bencher/tree/main/examples/python/pytest-benchmark).

Create a Python file named `game.py`,
and set its contents to the above FizzBuzz implementation.

Then run `python game.py`.
The output should look like:

<FizzBuzzOutput />

> 🐰 Boom! You're cracking the coding interview!

Before going any further, it is important to discuss the differences between micro-benchmarking and macro-benchmarking.
