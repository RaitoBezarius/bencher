## Expand FizzBuzzFibonacci in Python

Our game is a hit! The kids do indeed love playing FizzBuzzFibonacci.
So much so that word has come down from the execs that they want a sequel.
But this is the modern world, we need Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) not one time purchases!
The new vision for our game is that it is open ended, no more living between the bound of `1` and `100` (even if it is inclusive).
No, we're on to new frontiers!

In order to have our game work for any number, we will need to accept a command line argument.
Update the default control flow to look like this:

{ props.children }

- Import the `sys` package.
- Collect all of the arguments (`args`) passed to our game from the command line.
- Get the first argument passed to our game and check to see if it is a digit.
  - If so, parse the first argument as an integer, `i`.
  - Play our game with the newly parsed unsigned integer `i`.
- If parsing fails or no argument is passed in, default to prompting for a valid input.

Now we can play our game with any number!
Run `python game.py` followed by an integer to play our game:

<FizzBuzzFibonacciOpenOutput />

And if we omit or provide an invalid number:

<FizzBuzzFibonacciOpenOutputDefault />

Wow, that was some thorough testing! CI passes. Our bosses are thrilled.
Let's ship it! ðŸš€
