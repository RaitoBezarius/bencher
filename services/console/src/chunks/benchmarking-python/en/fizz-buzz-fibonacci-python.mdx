## Write FizzBuzzFibonacci in Python

Our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are down,
so our Product Manager (PM) wants us to add a new feature.
After much brainstorming and many user interviews,
it is decided that good ole FizzBuzz isn't enough.
Kids these days want a new game, FizzBuzzFibonacci.

<IsFibonacciNumberCode />

- Create a function named `is_fibonacci_number` that takes in an integer and returns a boolean.
- Iterate for all number from `0` to our given number `n` inclusive.
- Initialize our Fibonacci sequence starting with `0` and `1` as the `previous` and `current` numbers respectively.
- Iterate while the `current` number is less than the current iteration `i`.
- Add the `previous` and `current` number to get the `next_value` number.
- Update the `previous` number to the `current` number.
- Update the `current` number to the `next_value` number.
- Once `current` is greater than or equal to the given number `n`, we will exit the loop.
- Check to see is the `current` number is equal to the given number `n` and if so return `True`.
- Otherwise, return `False`.

Now we will need to update our `fizz_buzz` function:

<FizzBuzzFibonacciCode />

- Rename the `fizz_buzz` function to `fizz_buzz_fibonacci` to make it more descriptive.
- Call our `is_fibonacci_number` helper function.
- If the result from `is_fibonacci_number` is `True` then return `Fibonacci`.
- If the result from `is_fibonacci_number` is `False` then perform the same `Fizz`, `Buzz`, `FizzBuzz`, or number logic returning the result.

Because we renamed `fizz_buzz` to `fizz_buzz_fibonacci` we also need to update our `play_game` function:

{ props.children }

Both our main execution and the `test_game` function can stay exactly the same.
