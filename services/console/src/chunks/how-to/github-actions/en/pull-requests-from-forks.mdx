## Pull Requests from Forks

If you plan to accept pull requests from forks, as is often the case in public open source projects,
then you will need to handle things a little differently.
For security reasons, secrets such as your `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` and the `GITHUB_TOKEN` are not available in GitHub Actions for fork PRs.
That is if an external contributor opens up a PR from a fork the above example will **not** work.
See this [GitHub Security Lab write up][github actions pwn requests]
and [this blog post][nathandavison.com blog]
on preventing pwn requests for a full overview.

This is the safe and suggested way to add [Continuous Benchmarking][continuous benchmarking] to fork pull requests.
It requires two separate workflows.
The first workflow runs and caches the benchmark results in the `pull_request` context.
No secrets such as your `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` and the `GITHUB_TOKEN` are available there.
Then a second workflow downloads the cached benchmark results in the `workflow_run` context and uploads them to Bencher.
This works because `workflow_run` runs in the context of the repository's default branch,
where secrets such as your `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` and the `GITHUB_TOKEN` are available.
The pull request number, head branch, and base branch used in the initial `pull_request` workflow
must also be explicitly passed into the `workflow_run` workflow since they are not available there.
These workflows will only run if they exist on the _default_ branch.
See [using data from the triggering workflow][github actions trigger workflow] for a full overview.
