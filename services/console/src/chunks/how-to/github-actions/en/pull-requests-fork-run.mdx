1. Create a first GitHub Actions `workflow` file.
   (ex: `.github/workflows/fork_pr_benchmarks_run.yml`)
2. Name this workflow so it can be referenced by the second workflow.
   (ex: `name: Run and Cache Benchmarks`)
3. Run on `pull_request` events:
    - `opened` - A pull request was created.
    - `reopened` - A previously closed pull request was reopened.
    - `edited` - The title or body of a pull request was edited, or the base branch of a pull request was changed.
    - `synchronize` - A pull request's head branch was updated.
      For example, the head branch was updated from the base branch or new commits were pushed to the head branch.

   See the [GitHub Actions `on` documentation][github actions on]
   and [GitHub Actions `pull_request` documentation][github action pull_request] for a full overview.
   (ex: `on: pull_request: types: [opened, reopened, edited, synchronize]`)
4. Create a GitHub Actions `job`.
   (ex: `jobs: benchmark_fork_pr_branch`)
5. Set the type of machine the job will run on.
   See the [GitHub Actions `runs-on` documentation][github actions runs-on]
   for a full overview.
   (ex: `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`)
6. Checkout the fork PR branch source code.
   (ex: `uses: actions/checkout@v4`)
7. Run your benchmarks and save the results to a file.
   (ex: `/bin/echo '{ ... }' > benchmark_results.json`)
8. Upload the benchmark results file as an artifact.
   (ex: `uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4`)
9. Upload the `pull_request` event object as an artifact.
  (ex: `uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4`)
