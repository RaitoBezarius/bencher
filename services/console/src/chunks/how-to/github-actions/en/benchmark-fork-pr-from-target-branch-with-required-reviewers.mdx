### Benchmark Fork PR from Target Branch with Required Reviewers

In order to guarantee that the code from a fork pull request is safe,
this GitHub Action checks to see if the fork is from another repository.
If the fork is from another repository, then it will need to be reviewed.

> ⚠️ It is **very**, **very** important to thoroughly review every fork PR before approving!
> Not doing so could result in a pwn request!
>
> If you would prefer to not have that hanging over your head, see [Benchmark Fork PR and Upload from Default Branch][benchmark fork pr and upload from default branch] above.

In order to get this workflow configured, you need to create two
[GitHub Actions Environments][github actions environments].
Navigate to `Your Repo -> Settings -> Environments -> New environment`.
Create two new environments, `internal` and `external`.
The `internal` environment should have no `Deployment protection rules`.
However, the `external` environment should have `Required reviewers` set to those trusted to review fork PRs before benchmarking.
See [this blog post][iterative.ai blog] for a full overview.

This setup works because `pull_request_target` runs in the context of the pull request's target branch,
where secrets such as your `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` and the `GITHUB_TOKEN` are available.
Therefore, this workflow will only run if it exists on the _target_ branch.
Avoid setting any secrets as environment variables, such as `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `BENCHER_API_TOKEN`.
Instead explicitly pass in your secrets to `bencher run`.

1. Create a GitHub Actions `workflow` file.
   (ex: `.github/workflows/pr_target_benchmarks.yml`)
2. Run on `pull_request` events:
    - `opened` - A pull request was created.
    - `reopened` - A previously closed pull request was reopened.
    - `edited` - The title or body of a pull request was edited, or the base branch of a pull request was changed.
    - `synchronize` - A pull request's head branch was updated.
      For example, the head branch was updated from the base branch or new commits were pushed to the head branch.

   See the [GitHub Actions `on` documentation][github actions on]
   and [GitHub Actions `pull_request` documentation][github action pull_request] for a full overview.
   (ex: `on: pull_request: types: [opened, reopened, edited, synchronize]`)
3. Create a first GitHub Actions `job` to check if the workflow requires review.
   (ex: `jobs: fork_pr_requires_review`)
4. Set the `environment` to `internal` if and only if the pull request is from the same repository.
   Otherwise, set the `environment` to `external`, which will require an approval from a reviewer to continue on.
   ⚠️ DO NOT REMOVE THIS LINE!
   (ex: `environment: ${{ (github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository && 'internal') || 'external' }}`)
5. Create a second GitHub Actions `job` to run your benchmarks.
   (ex: `benchmark_fork_pr_branch`)
6. Have the `benchmark_fork_pr_branch` job need the `fork_pr_requires_review` job in order to run.
   ⚠️ DO NOT REMOVE THIS LINE!
   See the [GitHub Actions `needs` documentation][github actions needs]
   for a full overview.
   (ex: `needs: fork_pr_requires_review`)
7. Set the type of machine the job will run on.
   See the [GitHub Actions `runs-on` documentation][github actions runs-on]
   for a full overview.
   (ex: `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`)
8. Checkout the fork PR source code.
   Since `pull_request_target` runs in the context of the pull request's target branch,
   you still need to checkout the pull request branch.
   (ex: `uses: actions/checkout@v4`)
    - Specify the fork PR repository (ex: `repository: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}`)
    - Specify the fork PR hash (ex: `ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}`)
    - Do not persist your `git` credential (ex: `persist-credentials: false`)
9. Install the Bencher CLI using [the GitHub Action][bencher cli github action].
   (ex: `uses: bencherdev/bencher@main`)
10. Use the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand
    to run your fork pull branch benchmarks.
    See [the `bencher run` CLI subcommand][bencher run] for a full overview.
    (ex: `bencher run`)
11. Set the `--project` option to the Project slug.
    See [the `--project` docs][project option] for more details.
    (ex: `--project save-walter-white-1234abcd`)
12. Set the `--token` option to the `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` **Repository** secret.
    See [the `--token` docs][token option] for more details.
    (ex: `--token '${{ secrets.BENCHER_API_TOKEN }}'`)
13. Set the `--branch` option to the formatted fork PR number using
    [the GitHub Actions `pull_request` event][github action pull_request].
    See [branch selection][branch selection branch] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--branch '${{ github.event.number }}/merge'`)
14. Set the `--branch-start-point` option to the fork PR base Branch start point using
    [the GitHub Actions `github` context][github actions context].
    See [branch selection][branch selection start point] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--branch-start-point '${{ github.base_ref }}'`)
15. Set the `--branch-start-point-hash` option to the fork PR base Branch start point hash using
    [the GitHub Actions `pull_request` event][github action pull_request].
    See [branch selection][branch selection start point hash] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--branch-start-point-hash '${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}'`)
16. Set the `--branch-reset` flag to always reset the Branch to the start point.
    This will prevent benchmark data drift.
    See [branch selection][branch selection branch reset] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--branch-reset`)
17. Set the `--testbed` option to the Testbed name.
    This should likely match the machine selected in `runs-on`.
    See [the `--tested` docs][testbed option] for more details.
    (ex: `--testbed ubuntu-latest`)
18. Set the `--adapter` option to the desired benchmark harness adapter.
    See [benchmark harness adapters][adapters] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--adapter json`)
19. Set the `--err` flag to fail the command if an Alert is generated.
    See [Threshold & Alerts][alerts] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--err`)
20. Set the `--github-actions` option to the GitHub API authentication token to post results as a comment on the Pull Request using
    [the GitHub Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable][github token].
    See [the `--github-actions` docs][github actions option] for more details.
    (ex: `--github-actions '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'`)
21. Specify the benchmark command arguments.
    See [benchmark command][command argument] for a full overview.
    (ex: `bencher mock`)
