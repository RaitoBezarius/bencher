### Benchmark Fork PR and Upload from Default Branch

This is the safe and suggested way to add [Continuous Benchmarking][continuous benchmarking] to fork pull requests.
It requires two separate workflows.
The first workflow runs and caches the benchmark results in the `pull_request` context.
No secrets such as your `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` and the `GITHUB_TOKEN` are available there.
Then a second workflow downloads the cached benchmark results in the `workflow_run` context and uploads them to Bencher.
This works because `workflow_run` runs in the context of the repository's default branch,
where secrets such as your `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` and the `GITHUB_TOKEN` are available.
The pull request number, head branch, and base branch used in the initial `pull_request` workflow
must also be explicitly passed into the `workflow_run` workflow since they are not available there.
These workflows will only run if they exist on the _default_ branch.
See [using data from the triggering workflow][github actions trigger workflow] for a full overview.

<PullRequestsForkRunCode />

1. Create a first GitHub Actions `workflow` file.
   (ex: `.github/workflows/fork_pr_benchmarks_run.yml`)
2. Name this workflow so it can be referenced by the second workflow.
   (ex: `name: Run and Cache Benchmarks`)
3. Run on `pull_request` events:
    - `opened` - A pull request was created.
    - `reopened` - A previously closed pull request was reopened.
    - `edited` - The title or body of a pull request was edited, or the base branch of a pull request was changed.
    - `synchronize` - A pull request's head branch was updated.
      For example, the head branch was updated from the base branch or new commits were pushed to the head branch.

   See the [GitHub Actions `on` documentation][github actions on]
   and [GitHub Actions `pull_request` documentation][github action pull_request] for a full overview.
   (ex: `on: pull_request: types: [opened, reopened, edited, synchronize]`)
4. Create a GitHub Actions `job`.
   (ex: `jobs: benchmark_fork_pr_branch`)
5. Set the type of machine the job will run on.
   See the [GitHub Actions `runs-on` documentation][github actions runs-on]
   for a full overview.
   (ex: `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`)
6. Checkout the fork PR branch source code.
   (ex: `uses: actions/checkout@v4`)
7. Run your benchmarks and save the results to a file.
   (ex: `/bin/echo '{ ... }' > benchmark_results.json`)
8. Upload the benchmark results file as an artifact.
   (ex: `uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4`)
9. Upload the `pull_request` event object as an artifact.
  (ex: `uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4`)

<PullRequestsForkTrackCode />

1. Create a first GitHub Actions `workflow` file.
   (ex: `.github/workflows/fork_pr_benchmarks_track.yml`)
2. Name this workflow second workflow.
   (ex: `name: Track Benchmarks with Bencher`)
3. Chain the two workflows with
   [the `workflow_run` event][github actions workflow_run].
   (ex: `on: workflow_run: ...`)
4. Create a GitHub Actions `job`.
   (ex: `jobs: track_fork_pr_branch`)
5. Only run this job if the previous workflow's conclusion was a success using
   [the GitHub Actions `workflow_run` event][github actions workflow_run].
   (ex: `if: github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'`)
6. Set the type of machine the job will run on.
   See the [GitHub Actions `runs-on` documentation][github actions runs-on]
   for a full overview.
   (ex: `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`)
7. Set the benchmark results and `pull_request` event object file names as environment variables.
   (ex: `env: ...`)
8. Download the cached benchmark results and `pull_request` event
   using [the `action-download-artifact` GitHub Action][action download artifact].
   (ex: `uses: dawidd6/action-download-artifact@v6`)
10. Export the necessary data from the `pull_request` event as environment variables.
    (ex: `core.exportVariable(...)`)
11. Install the Bencher CLI using [the GitHub Action][bencher cli github action].
   (ex: `uses: bencherdev/bencher@main`)
12. Use the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand
    to track your fork pull branch benchmarks.
    See [the `bencher run` CLI subcommand][bencher run] for a full overview.
    (ex: `bencher run`)
13. Set the `--project` option to the Project slug.
    See [the `--project` docs][project option] for more details.
    (ex: `--project save-walter-white-1234abcd`)
14. Set the `--token` option to the `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` **Repository** secret.
    See [the `--token` docs][token option] for more details.
    (ex: `--token '${{ secrets.BENCHER_API_TOKEN }}'`)
15. Set the `--branch` option to the fork PR branch name using
    [the GitHub Actions `github` context][github actions context].
    See [the `--branch` docs][branch option] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--branch '${{ env.PR_HEAD }}'`)
13. Set the Start Point for the fork PR Branch:
    1. Set the `--start-point` option to the fork PR Branch start point
    using [the GitHub Actions `github` context][github actions context].
    See [the `--start-point` docs][start point] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--start-point '${{ env.PR_BASE }}'`)
    2. Set the `--start-point-hash` option to the fork PR Branch start point `git` hash
    using [the GitHub Actions `pull_request` event][github action pull_request].
    See [the `--start-point-hash` docs][start point hash] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--start-point-hash '${{ env.PR_BASE_SHA }}'`)
    3. Set the `--start-point-clone-thresholds` flag to clone the Thresholds from the start point.
    See [the `--start-point-clone-thresholds` docs][start point clone thresholds] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--start-point-clone-thresholds`)
    4. Set the `--start-point-reset` flag to always reset the fork PR Branch to the start point.
    This will prevent benchmark data drift.
    See [the `--start-point-reset` docs][start point reset] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--start-point-reset`)
14. Set the `--testbed` option to the Testbed name.
    This should likely match the machine selected in `runs-on`.
    See [the `--tested` docs][testbed option] for more details.
    (ex: `--testbed ubuntu-latest`)
15. Set the `--err` flag to fail the command if an Alert is generated.
   See [the `--err` docs][alert err] for a full overview.
   (ex: `--err`)
16. Set the `--adapter` option to [Bencher Metric Format JSON (`json`)][bmf] that is generated by `bencher mock`.
   See [benchmark harness adapters][adapter json] for a full overview.
   (ex: `--adapter json`)
17. Set the `--github-actions` option to the GitHub API authentication token to post results as a comment on the Pull Request using
    [the GitHub Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable][github token].
    See [the `--github-actions` docs][github actions option] for more details.
    (ex: `--github-actions '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'`)
18. Set the `--ci-number` option to the pull request number.
    See [the `--ci-number` docs][ci number option] for more details.
    (ex: `--ci-number '${{ env.PR_NUMBER }}'`)
19. Set the `--file` option to the benchmark results file path.
    See [benchmark command][command argument] for a full overview.
    (ex: `--file "$BENCHMARK_RESULTS"`)
