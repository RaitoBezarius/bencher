Depending on your use case, you can set up [Continuous Benchmarking][continuous benchmarking] in GitHub Actions for your:

- [Base Branch][base branch]
- [Pull Requests][pull requests]
- [Pull Requests from Forks][fork pull requests]

Make sure you have [created an API token][create an api token]
and set it as a **Repository** secret named `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` before continuing on!
Navigate to `Your Repo -> Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret`.
Name the secret `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` and set the secret value to your API token.

In GitHub Actions,
[secrets are not passed to the runner when a workflow is triggered from a forked repository][github actions secrets].
Therefore, you will need to use a branch from the _same_ repository
when adding any of the workflows below to your repository with a pull request.
If you try to add Bencher with a pull request from a fork,
then the `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` secret will not be available.
`${{ secrets.BENCHER_API_TOKEN }}` will be an empty string.
