This is an example of BMF JSON:

In this example, the key `benchmark_name` would be the name of a [Benchmark][benchmark].
Benchmark names can be any non-empty string up to 1024 characters.
The `benchmark_name` object can contain multiple [Measure][measure] names, slugs, or UUIDs as keys.
If the value specified is a name or slug and the Measure does not already exist, it will be created for you.
However, if the value specified is a UUID then the Measure must already exist.
In this example, `latency` is the slug for the built-in Latency Measure.
Each Project by default has a Latency (ie `latency`) and Throughput (ie `throughput`) Measure,
which are measured in `nanosecond (ns)` and `operations / second (ops/s)` respectively.
The Measure object contains a [Metric][metric] with up to three values:
`value`, `lower_value`, and `upper_value`.
The `lower_value` and `upper_value` values are optional.

In this example, the `latency` Measure object contains the following values:

- A `value` of `88.0`
- A `lower_value` of `87.42`
- An `upper_value` of `88.88`
