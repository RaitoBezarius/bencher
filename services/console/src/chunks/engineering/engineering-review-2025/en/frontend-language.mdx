### Frontend Language

Astro has [built-in TypeScript support][astro typescript].
In the transition from SolidStart to Astro, I also started the transition form JavaScript to TypeScript.
Bencher's TypeScript config is set to Astro's `strictest` setting.
However, Astro does not perform type checking during builds.
As of writing, Bencher still has `604` type errors.
These type errors are used more like hints when editing code,
but they don't block the build ([yet][github issue 557]).

I also added [Typeshare][typeshare github] to sync Bencher's Rust data types with the TypeScript frontend.
This has been incredibly helpful for developing the Bencher Console.
Further, all the field validators for things like usernames, emails, etc
are shared between the Rust code and the TypeScript frontend [via WASM][github wasm bindgen].
It's been a bit of a hassle to get WASM working in both SolidStart and Astro.
The largest class of error that I've seen in the frontend has been places where a WASM function is called
but the WASM module hasn't loaded yet.
I've figured out how to fix it, but I'll still sometimes forget and it crops up again.

Having both the shared types and validators auto-generated from the Rust code
has made interfacing with the frontend much easier.
They both get checked in CI, so they are never out of sync.
All I have to do is make sure the HTTP requests are well formed,
and it all just works.
This makes not being able to use full-stack Rust sting a little less.
