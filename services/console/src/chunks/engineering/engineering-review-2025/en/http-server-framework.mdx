### HTTP Server Framework

One of my top considerations when selecting a Rust HTTP server framework
was built-in [OpenAPI spec][openapi spec] support.
For the same reasons that I invested in setting up
[Typeshare and WASM on the frontend][frontend language],
I wanted the ability to auto-generate both API docs and clients from that spec.
It was important to me that this functionality was built-in and not a third-party add-on.
For the automation to actually be worth it, it has to work pretty close to 100% of the time.
This means the maintenance and compatibility burden needs to be on the core framework engineers themselves.
Otherwise, you will inevitably find yourself in edge case hell.

Another key consideration was the risk of abandonment.
There are several once promising Rust HTTP frameworks that now sit all but abandoned.
The only framework that I found that had built-in OpenAPI spec support
that I was willing to bet on was [Dropshot][dropshot github].
Dropshot was created and is still maintained by [Oxide Computer][oxide computer].

I've only had one major issue with Dropshot thus far.
When an error is generated by the API server, it causes a CORS failure on the frontend due to missing response headers.
This means that the web frontend can't display very helpful error messages to users.
Instead of working on upstreaming a fix, I put my efforts towards making Bencher easier and more intuitive to use.
But it turns out the solution was [less than 100 lines of code][dropshot github issue 1193].
Jokes on me!

As an aside, [the `axum` framework][axum github] had not yet been released when I started working on Bencher.
If it had been around at the time, I may have tried to pair it with one of the many 3rd party OpenAPI add-ons,
despite my better judgment.
Lucky for me, `axum` wasn't yet there to tempt me.
Dropshot has been a great choice.
See the [API Client][api client] section for more on this point.
