### Continuous Integration

Bencher is [open source][github bencher].
As a modern open source project, you sort of have to be on GitHub.
This means the path of least resistance for continuous integration (CI) is GitHub Actions.
Over the years, I've began to loathe the YAML based CI DSLs.
They each have their own quarks, and when it comes to a company as big as GitHub,
getting a ⚠️ icon instead of an ❌ icon can [languish for years][github runner 2347].

This motivated me to try out [Dagger][github dagger].
At the time, you could only use Dagger via this esoteric language called [CUE][cue].
I tried. I really did. For like a whole weekend.
Maybe if ChatGPT had existed back then, I could have made it through.
But it wasn't just me.
Dagger eventually [abandoned CUE][dagger cue] altogether for more sane SDKs.
By that time though, it was too late for me.

Defeated by Dagger, I accepted my YAML CI DSL fate,
and Bencher now uses GitHub Actions.
Heck, I even built a [Bencher CLI][github bencher cli] GitHub Action.
Be the ~~change~~ problem you wish to see in the world.
