### Database

I've tried to keep Bencher as simple as possible.
The first version of Bencher took everything,
including the benchmarks results themselves through URL query params.
I quickly learned that all browsers have [a limit on URL length][chrome url length].
Makes sense.

Next, I considered storing the benchmark results in `git`
and just generating a static HTML file with the plots and results.
However, this approach has two major draw backs.
First, the `git clone` times would eventually become untenable for heavy users.
Second, all historical data would have to be present in the HTML file,
leading to very long initial load times for heavy users.
A dev tool should love their heavy users, not punish them.

It turns out there's a solution to my problem.
It's called a database.

So why not just pull in Postgres and call it a day?
Well, I really wanted folks to be able to [self-host Bencher][bencher self hosted].
The simpler I could make the architecture,
the easier (and cheaper) it would be for others to self-host.
I was already going to require two containers due to the separate frontend and backend.
Could I avoid a third? Yep!

Before Bencher, I had only used [SQLite][sqlite] as a test database.
The developer experience was fantastic, but I never considered running it in production.
Then I came across [Litestream][github litestream].
Litestream is a disaster recovery tool for SQLite.
It runs in the background and continuously replicates changes to S3
or any other datastore of your choosing.
This makes it both easy to use and incredibly cost efficient to run,
since S3 doesn't charge for writes.
Think pennies per day for a small instance.

When I first ran across Litestream,
there was also the promise of live read replicas coming soon.
However, this [never came to fruition][litestream github issue 8].
The suggested alternative was a successor project by the same developer
called [LiteFS][github litefs].
There are major downsides to LiteFS though.
It does not offer built-in disaster recovery, if all replicas go down.
In order to have multiple replicas,
you have to infect your application logic with the concept of whether they are a reader or a writer.
And the absolute blocker was that it requires a [Consul][github consul] instance
to be running at all times to manage the replicas.
The entire point of using SQLite was to avoid yet another service.
Thankfully, I didn't try to use LiteFS with Bencher Cloud either,
as [LiteFS Cloud was sunset a year after launch][litefs sunset],
and [LiteFS is now all but dead][github litefs contributors].

Currently, the small downtime between deploys is [handled by the Bencher CLI][bencher attempts].
In the future, I plan to move to zero-downtime deploys using [Kamal][github kamal].
With [Rails 8.0 defaulting to Kamal and SQLite][rails 8],
I feel fairly confident that Kamal and Litestream should pair well together.
