### Backend Hosting

In the same way that I chose Netlify for my frontend hosting because I was using Solid,
I chose [Fly.io][fly io] for my backend hosting because I was using Litestream.
[Fly.io had just hired the creator of Litestream to work on it full-time][fly io sqlite].
As mentioned above, this work on Litestream was eventually cannibalized by LiteFS,
and LiteFS is now dead.
So that didn't really pan out as I had hoped.

In the future when I switch to [Kamal][github kamal], I'll also be moving off of Fly.io.
Fly.io has had a couple of major outages which took Bencher down for half-a-day each time.
But the biggest issue is the impedance mismatch that comes from using Litestream.

Every time I log into the Fly.io dashboard, I see this warning:

> <h4>ℹ Your app is running on a single machine</h4>
>
> Scale and run your app on more Machines to ensure high availability with one command:
> ```
> fly scale count 2
> ```
> Check out the [documentation](https://fly.io/docs/launch/scale-count/) for more details on scaling.

But with Litestream, you still can't have more than one machine!
You all never delivered read replication, like you promised!

So yeah, that's all a little ironic and frustrating.
At one point, I looked into [libSQL][github libsql] and [Turso][turso].
However, libSQL requires a special backend server for replication
which makes it [not work with Diesel][libsql github issue 1180].
Either way, it looks like I dodged another [end-of-life shutdown][turso roadmap] there as well.
I am very interested to see what Turso does with [Limbo][github limbo], their Rust rewrite of SQLite.
But I won't be making that switch anytime soon.
The next stop is a nice, boring, and stable VM running Kamal.

The [AWS S3][aws s3] backend for the Litestream replication has worked flawlessly.
Even with the rug pull around Litestream and Fly.io,
I still think I made the right call using Litestream with Bencher.
I'm starting to hit some scaling issues with Bencher Cloud,
but this as a good problem to have.
