### Frontend Hosting

My initial decision to go "all-in" on Solid was pretty heavily influence by
[Netlify hiring the creator of Solid to work on it full-time][dev to netlify].
You see, Netlify's biggest competitor is [Vercel][vercel].
Vercel created and maintains [Next.js][next js github].
And I figured Netlify wanted Solid to be their Next.js.
Therefore, I thought there would be no better place to host a SolidStart site than Netlify.

By default, Netlify tries to get you to use their build system.
Using Netlify's build system makes it very hard to do atomic deploys.
Netlify would still publish the frontend even if the backend pipeline failed.
Very bad!
This lead me to move over to building the frontend in the same [CI/CD environment][continuous integration] as the backend
and then just uploading the latest version to Netlify with their CLI.
When I made the transition from SolidStart to Astro,
I was able to keep the same CI/CD setup.
Astro has a first-party [Netlify integration][astro netlify].

Bencher managed to stay under the Netlify free tier for quite some time.
With Bencher's increasing popularity though,
we have started to exceed some of the free tier limits.
I have considered moving the Astro site over to [`sst` on AWS][sst aws astro].
However, the cost savings haven't seemed worth the effort at this point.
