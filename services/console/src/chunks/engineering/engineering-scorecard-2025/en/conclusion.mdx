## Conclusion

Building Bencher has taught me a lot about the trade-offs
that come with each engineering decision.
There are some choices that I would make differently now,
but that's a good thing.
It means that I've learned a thing or two along the way.
Overall, I'm very happy with where Bencher is today.
Bencher has gone form a sketch in my notebook to a full-fledged product
with a growing user base, a vibrant community, and paying customers.
I'm excited to see where the next three years take us!
