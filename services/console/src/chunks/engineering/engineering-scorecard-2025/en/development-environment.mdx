### Developer Environment

As I started working on Bencher, folks were calling for [the end of localhost][dx tips].
I was already well past the need for a new development laptop,
so I decided to try out a cloud development environment.
At the time GitHub Workspaces wasn't generally available (GA) for my use case,
so I went with [Gitpod][gitpod].

This experiment lasted for about six months.
My conclusion: cloud development environments do not work well for side projects.
Do you want to hop on and knock out five minutes of work?
Nope! You're going to sit there and wait for your dev environment to reinitialize itself for the 1,000th time.
Oh, you have an entire afternoon on the weekend to really crank out some work?
Nope! Your dev environment is just going to [randomly stop working while you are using it][github gitpod 9629]. Again and again and again.

I ran into these issues as a paid user.
At $25/month, I could get a brand new M1 MacBook Pro with much better specs every five years.
When Gitpod announced they were changing their pricing from a flat rate to be usage based,
I just let them cancel my plan and headed on over to [apple.com][apple].

Maybe this was all an issue with Gitpod's [now abandoned decision][gitpod kubernetes] to use Kubernetes.
But I'm in no hurry to try out another cloud development environment with Bencher again.
I did eventually port the Gitpod configuration over to a [dev container][github bencher dev container]
to make it easier for contributors to get started.
For me though, I'm sticking with `localhost`.
