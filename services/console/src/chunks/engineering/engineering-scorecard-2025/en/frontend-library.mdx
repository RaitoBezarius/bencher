### Frontend Library

As a recovering C++ developer, I'm a pretty big fan of Rust.
If I had my druthers, I would have been able to write Bencher in full-stack Rust.
Dig back into the deep recesses of the [Bencher repo][bencher github],
you'll see me trying to do exactly that.
I experimented with [Yew][yew github], [Seed][seed github], and [Sycamore][sycamore github].
While they may work great for some projects,
there was one major sticking point I just couldn't get over: [JavaScript Interoperation][js ffi].

While JS interop is possible from WASM via Rust,
it was not going to be easy.
I knew I wanted Bencher to have highly interactive plots.
This meant using a library like [D3][d3 github],
which meant JS interop.

So if I was going to have to use JavaScript, which library should I choose?

Going back to those Rust crates I experimented with,
Yew is the Rust analogue to [React Hooks][react hooks].
I'd built and deployed a frontend using React Hooks in the past,
so I knew the most about this framework.
However, I found the React Hooks lifecycle very complicated
and full of gotcha, weird edge cases.

I really liked the core principals of [functional reactive programming][functional reactive programming] (FRP).
This lead me to trying out both [Elm][elm] and its Rust analogue, Seed.
Unfortunately, using Elm suffers from the same issues as using Rust.
Elm requires its own [JavaScript Interop][elm js interop].
I also found [The Elm Architecture][the elm architecture] a bit too restrictive for my liking.

Of all the Rust frameworks that I tried, I liked Sycamore the most.
Sycamore was inspired by [Solid][solid github].
The more that I learned about Solid, the more I liked it.
Unlike React, Solid does not use a [virtual DOM][react virtual dom].
Instead, it compiles to good ole JavaScript.
This makes it much faster, smaller, and easier to work with.
Solid is made up of just a few powerful primitives that allow for fine-grained reactivity.
When something in the UI gets updated, only the code that depends on it will rerun.
Over the past three years, I have found Solid to be a pleasure to work with.
