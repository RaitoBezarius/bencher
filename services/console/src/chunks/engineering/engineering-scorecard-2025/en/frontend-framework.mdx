### Frontend Framework

Solid itself is just a library.
In order to build a modern frontend,
I was going to need to use a full fledged web app framework.
Wanting to keep things simple, I put all of my eggs in the Solid basket,
and I initially used [SolidStart][solid start github].
At the time, SolidStart only supported single-page apps (SPAs).

An SPA was fine for getting going.
Eventually though, I needed to start caring about things like SEO.
I was beginning to write a lot more [Bencher documentation][bencher docs].
I was also planning [the Learn section][bencher learn] of the site.
This meant that I needed both client-side rendering (CSR)
and static site generation (SSG).
SolidStart was very young, and I couldn't get it to meet all of my needs.

After learning about [Astro][astro] and trying it out,
I decided to port the entire Bencher frontend from SolidStart over to Astro.
This had a couple of drawbacks.
The most obvious was the effort involved.
Honestly, it wasn't _too_ bad.
Astro has its [islands architecture][astro islands] and
a first class [Solid integration][astro solid].
I was also able to take a lot of the logic that I need from the [Solid Router][solid router],
and it just sort of worked.

The great compromise which is still present today
is that Bencher went from a single-page app to a multi-page app.
Most places you click in the console cause a full page rerender.
Astro had the promise of [view transitions][astro view transitions],
when I first made the switch.
I tried them out, but they were buggy.
I still need to [circle back][github issue 556].

In the mean time, SolidStart seems to have caught up some.
They now support both CSR and SSG.
Though I haven't checked whether they both work on the same site like I need.
Water under the bridge.
