### API Client

A major factor in picking [Dropshot][github dropshot] as Bencher's
[HTTP server framework][http server framework]
was its built-in ability to generate an [OpenAPI spec][openapi spec].
I was hopeful that one day I could auto-generate an API client from that spec.
A year or so later, the creators of Dropshot delivered: [Progenitor][github progenitor].

Progenitor is the yin to Dropshot's yang.
Using the OpenAPI spec from Dropshot, Progenitor can generate a Rust API client
in either a positional pattern:

```
client.instance_create("bencher", "api", None)
```

or a builder pattern:

```
client.instance_create().organization("bencher").project("api").send()
```

Personally, I prefer the latter,
so that's what Bencher uses.
Progenitor can also generate an entire Clap CLI to interact with the API.
However, I haven't used it.
I needed to have tighter control over things,
especially for commands like [`bencher run`][bencher run].

The only notable downside I've found with the generated types is that
due to limitations in JSON Schema, you can't just use an `Option<Option<Item>>`
when you need to be able to disambiguate between a missing `item` key and an `item` key with the value set to `null`.
This is possible with something like [`double_option`][docs serde with double option],
but it all looks the same at the level of the JSON Schema.
Using a [flattened][serde flattened] or [untagged][serde untagged] inner struct enum
doesn't play nice with Dropshot.
The only solution that I found was to use [a top-level, untagged enum][github bencher json update project].
There are only two such fields in the entire API at this point though,
so not a huge deal.
