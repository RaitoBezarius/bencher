### Database Driver

The closer to the database I get, the more strongly typed I want things.
It's okay to play a little fast and loose on the frontend.
If I mess up, everything will be right as rain with the next push to production.
If I corrupt the database though, it's much more of an ordeal to set right.
With that in mind, I chose to use [Diesel][diesel github].

Diesel is a strongly typed object relational mapper (ORM) and query builder for Rust.
It checks all database interactions at compile time, preventing runtime errors.
This compile time checking also makes Diesel a zero-cost abstraction over SQL.
Other than a small bug on my end when making things [1200x faster with performance tuning][engineering sqlite],
I have had no runtime SQL errors when working with Diesel.
