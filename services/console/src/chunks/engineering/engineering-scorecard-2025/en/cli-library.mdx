### CLI Library

When building a Rust CLI, [Clap][github clap] is a bit of a de facto standard.
So imagine my shock when [I first publicly demoed Bencher][talks rust dc]
and the creator himself, [Ed Page][github epage], was there! 🤩

Over time, I keep finding more and more helpful things that Clap can do.
It's a bit embarrassing, but I just recently discovered
[the `default_value` option][docs clap default value].
All of these capabilities really help to shrink the amount of code I have to maintain
in the `bencher` CLI.

> 🐰 Fun Fact: [Clap uses Bencher][clap github pr 5826] to [track binary size][track binary size]!
