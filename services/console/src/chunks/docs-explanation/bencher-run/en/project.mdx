### `--project <PROJECT>`

<br />

Optional: Either the `--project` option or the `BENCHER_PROJECT` environment variable
may be set to the slug or UUID for a Project.
If the value specified is a slug and the Project does not already exist, it will be created for you.
However, if the value specified is a UUID then the Project must already exist.
If both are specified, the `--project` option takes precedence over the `BENCHER_PROJECT` environment variable.
If neither are specified then a Project slug will be generated for you based on:

1. The name of the parent directory for the `git` repository, if it is available.
2. The root hash for the `git` repository, if it is available.
3. A 13 digit alphanumeric fingerprint of your system, for supported operating systems.

If neither are specified then `Linux`, `macOS`, or `Windows` is used,
based on the host operating system.
If the `bencher` CLI has been compiled for a different operating system,
then `localhost` is used as the default Testbed.

Either the `--project` option or the `BENCHER_PROJECT` environment variable
must be set to the slug or UUID of an already existing project.
If both are specified, the `--project` option takes precedence over the `BENCHER_PROJECT` environment variable.
