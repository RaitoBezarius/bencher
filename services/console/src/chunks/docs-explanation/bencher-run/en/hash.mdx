### `--hash <HASH>`

<br />

Optional: A 40-character SHA-1 `git` commit hash.
If two reports have the same branch and hash, they will be considered to be from the same commit.
Therefore, they will have the same branch version number.

If not provided, the Bencher CLI tries to find the current `git` hash.
It starts by looking for a `git` repository in the current working directory.
If unsuccessful, it continues to its parent directory and retries all the way up to the root directory.
If a `git` repository is found, then the current branch's HEAD `git` hash is used.
