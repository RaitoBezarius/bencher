### `--github-actions <GITHUB_TOKEN>`

<br />

Optional: Set the GitHub API authentication token.
The most convenient way to do this is the [GitHub Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable][github token] (ie `--github-actions ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`).
When this option is set and `bencher run` is used in GitHub Actions as a part of a pull request,
then the results will be added to the pull request as a comment.
This requires the token to have [the `pull-requests` scope with `write` permissions][github token permissions].
Otherwise, the results will be added to the commit as a GitHub Check.
This requires the token to have [the `checks` scope with `write` permissions][github token permissions].
In either case, the results will also be added to the job summary.
