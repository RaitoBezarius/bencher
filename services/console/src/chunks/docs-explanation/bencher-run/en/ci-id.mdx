### `--ci-id <ID>`

<br />

Optional: Custom ID for posting results to CI.
By default, Bencher will automatically segment out results by the combination of: Project, Branch, Testbed, and [Adapter](/docs/explanation/adapters/).
Setting a custom ID is useful when Bencher is being run multiple times in the same CI workflow for the same Project, Branch, Testbed, and Adapter combination.
Requires: `--github-actions`
