### Branch
A Branch is the `git` ref used when running a Report (ie branch name or tag).
By default all Projects start with a `main` Branch.
When using the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand,
`main` is the default Branch if one is not provided.
See [branch selection](/docs/explanation/branch-selection/) for a full overview.
