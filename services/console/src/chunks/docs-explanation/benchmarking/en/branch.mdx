### Branch
A Branch is the `git` ref used when running a Report (ie branch name or tag).
When using the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand,
if a Branch is not specified then the current `git` branch name is used if it is available.
Otherwise, `main` is used as the default Branch.
See [branch selection](/docs/explanation/branch-selection/) for a full overview.
