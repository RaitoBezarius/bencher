### Testbed
A Testbed is the name of the testing environment used when running a Report.
When using the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand,
`Linux`, `macOS`, or `Windows` is used as the default Testbed based on the host operating system.
If the `bencher` CLI has been compiled for a different operating system,
then `localhost` is used.
