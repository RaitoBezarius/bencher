### Testbed
A Testbed is the name of the testing environment used when running a Report.
By default all Projects start with a `localhost` Testbed.
When using the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand,
`localhost` is the default Testbed if one is not provided.
