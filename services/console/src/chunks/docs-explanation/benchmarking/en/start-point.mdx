#### Start Point
A Branch can have a [Start Point][start point].
A Start Point is another Branch at a specific version (and `git` hash, if available).
Historical Metrics and optionally Thresholds are copied over from the Start Point.
See [branch selection](/docs/explanation/branch-selection/) for a full overview.
