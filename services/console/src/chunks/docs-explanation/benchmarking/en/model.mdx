### Model
A Model is the combination of a Test and its parameters for a Threshold.
A Model must have a Lower Boundary, Upper Boundary, or both.

- Lower Boundary
  - A Lower Boundary is used when a smaller value would indicate a performance regression,
  such as with the `Throughput` Measure.
- Upper Boundary
  - An Upper Boundary is used when a larger value would indicate a performance regression,
  such as with the `Latency` Measure.

Each Boundary is used to calculate a Boundary Limit.
Then every new Metric is checked against each Boundary Limit.
An Alert is generated when a new Metric is below a Lower Boundary Limit or above an Upper Boundary Limit.
