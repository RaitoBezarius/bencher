## `--err`

<br />

Optionally error when an Alert is generated.
An Alert is generated when a new [Metric][metric] is below a Lower Boundary Limit or above an Upper Boundary Limit.

### Suppressing Alerts
Sometimes it can be useful to suppress Alerts for a particular Benchmark.
The best way to do this is by adding one of these special suffixes to that Benchmark's name:

- `_bencher_ignore`
- `BencherIgnore`
- `-bencher-ignore`

For example, if your Benchmark was named `my_flaky_benchmark` then renaming it to `my_flaky_benchmark_bencher_ignore`
would ignore just that particular Benchmark going forward.
Ignored Benchmarks do get checked against existing Thresholds.
However, an Alert will not be generated for them.
The Metrics for ignored Benchmarks are still stored.
The results from `my_flaky_benchmark_bencher_ignore` would still be stored as the Benchmark `my_flaky_benchmark`.
If you remove the suffix and return to the original Benchmark name,
then things will pick right back up where you left off.
