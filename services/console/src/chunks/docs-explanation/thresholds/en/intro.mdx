Thresholds are how you catch performance regressions with Bencher.
A Threshold is assigned to a unique combination of:
[Branch][branch], [Testbed][testbed], and [Measure][measure].
A Threshold uses a specific [Test][tests] to detect performance regressions.
The combination of a Test and its parameters is called a Model.
A Model must have a Lower Boundary, Upper Boundary, or both.

- Lower Boundary
  - A Lower Boundary is used when a smaller value would indicate a performance regression,
  such as with the Throughput Measure.
- Upper Boundary
  - An Upper Boundary is used when a larger value would indicate a performance regression,
  such as with the Latency Measure.

Each Boundary is used to calculate a Boundary Limit.
Then every new [Metric][metric] is checked against each Boundary Limit.
An Alert is generated when a new Metric is below a Lower Boundary Limit or above an Upper Boundary Limit.

When [Continuous Benchmarking], that is benchmarking in CI you will want to create Thresholds.
Using the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand,
you already specify a Branch with [the `--branch` option][branch option]
and a Testbed with [the `--testbed` option][testbed option].
So the only other dimension you need to specify is a Measure, with the `--threshold-measure` option.
Then you can use the `--threshold-test` option to specify the Test to use for that Measure.
The `--threshold-min-sample-size`, `--threshold-max-sample-size`, and `--threshold-window` options
allow you to control what data is used by the Test.
Finally, the `--threshold-lower-boundary` and `--threshold-upper-boundary` options
allow you to set the Lower Boundary and Upper Boundary.
If you want to remove all Models that are not specified,
you can do so with the `--thresholds-reset` flag.

- If the Threshold does not exits, it will be created for you.
- If the Threshold does exist and the specified Model is the same, then the Model is ignored.
- If the Threshold does exist and the specified Model is different, then a new Model is created for the Threshold.
- If a Threshold does exist and it is reset, then the current Model is removed from the Threshold.

For example, to only use a Threshold for the Latency Measure
using [a Student's t-test Test][t-test]
with a maximum sample size of `64`
and an Upper Boundary of `0.99`, you could write something like this:

<ThresholdCode />

> 🐰 When working with feature branches, you may want to copy the existing Thresholds from the base, [Start Point][start point] Branch.
> This is possible with [the `--start-point-clone-thresholds` flag][start point clone thresholds flag].
Note that the `--thresholds-reset` flag will still remove any cloned Thresholds that are not explicitly specified.
