## `--threshold-max-sample-size <SAMPLE_SIZE>`

<br />

Optionally specify the maximum number of [Metrics][metric] used to run a Test.
If this maximum is exceeded, the oldest Metrics will be ignored.
The specified sample size must be greater than or equal to `2`.
If [the `--threshold-min-sample-size` option][threshold min sample size option] is also set,
then the specified sample size must be greater than or equal to `--threshold-min-sample-size`.
This option cannot be used with [the Static (`static`) Test][static].

For example, to use a Threshold with a maximum sample size of `100`,
you could write `--threshold-max-sample-size 100`.
If there were more than `100` Metrics, only the most recent `100` Metrics would be included.
Conversely, if there were `100` or fewer Metrics, all of the Metrics would be included.
