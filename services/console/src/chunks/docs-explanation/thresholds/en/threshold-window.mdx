## `--threshold-window <WINDOW>`

<br />

Optionally specify the window of time for [Metrics][metric] used to perform the Test, in seconds.
The specified window must be greater than `0`.
This option cannot be used with [the Static (`static`) Test][static].

For example, to use a Threshold with a window of four weeks or `2419200` seconds,
you could write `--threshold-window 2419200`.
If there are any Metrics older than four weeks, they would be excluded.
Conversely, if all Metrics are from within the past four weeks, they would all be included.
