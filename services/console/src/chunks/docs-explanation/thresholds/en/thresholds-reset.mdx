## `---thresholds-reset`

<br />

Reset all unspecified Thresholds for the given [Branch][branch] and [Testbed][testbed].
If a Threshold already exists and is not specified, its current [Model][model] will be removed.

For example, if there were two Thresholds for the `main` Branch and `localhost` Testbed:
- `main` Branch, `localhost` Testbed, `latency` [Measure][measure]
- `main` Branch, `localhost` Testbed, `throughput` [Measure][measure]

If only the `latency` Measure is specified in the `bencher run` subcommand
and `--thresholds-reset` is used,
then the `throughput` Measure would have its Model removed.
