## API Server URL

When using Bencher Self-Hosted,
you will need to set [the `--host` option][host option]
to the URL of your Bencher API server
for most `bencher` CLI subcommands.

For example, if you were using the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand
with a Bencher API server at `https://api.bencher.example.com`
then you could write something like this:

<BencherRunCode />

<br />

If you running the Bencher Console server on a different host than the Bencher API server,
you will also need to set [the `BENCHER_API_URL` environment variable][bencher api url environment variable]
on the Bencher Console server to the remote URL for your Bencher API server.

For example, if you are using the <code><a href="/docs/reference/bencher-compose/#bencher-up">bencher up</a></code> CLI subcommand
to start the Bencher Console server with a Bencher API server running at `https://api.bencher.example.com`
then you will need to set [the `--console-env` option][console env option] to the remote URL like this:

<BencherUpCode />

[host option]: /docs/explanation/bencher-run/#--host-url
[bencher api url environment variable]: /docs/reference/console-config/
[console env option]: /docs/reference/bencher-compose/#--console-env-key_value
