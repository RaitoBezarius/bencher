Bencher is [open source][github bencher].
It is available as a SaaS, [Bencher Cloud][bencher cloud],
and as a self-hostable set of Docker images:

- Bencher Console Server
  - [Configuration Reference](/docs/reference/console-config/)
  - [Download](/download/#console-server)
- Bencher API Server
  - [Configuration Reference](/docs/reference/server-config/)
  - [Download](/download/#api-server)

## Host URL

Whenever you are using a Bencher Self-Hosted instance,
you will need to set [the `--host` option][host option] for most `bencher` CLI subcommands.

For example, if you were using the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand,
then you might write:

```sh
bencher run \
--host https://bencher.example.com \
--project save-walter-white-1234abcd \
--branch main \
--testbed ci-runner \
--adapter json \
bencher mock
```

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy Bencher Self-Hosted is using a triptych of `bencher` CLI subcommands:

- `bencher up`: Bring up the Bencher Self-Hosted containers.
  This is similar to running `docker compose up`.
- `bencher logs`: Show the logs for the Bencher Self-Hosted containers,
  if `bencher up` was run with the `--detach` flag.
  This is similar to running `docker compose logs`.
- `bencher down`: Bring down the Bencher Self-Hosted containers,
  if `bencher up` was run the the `--detach` flag.
  This is similar to running `docker compose down`.

Alternatively, you could just use `docker compose` orchestrate the containers.
This is an example `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
version: "3.9"
services:
  bencher_api_compose:
    image: ghcr.io/bencherdev/bencher-api:latest
    container_name: bencher_api
    ports:
      - 61016:61016
    volumes:
      - "./services/api/etc:/etc/bencher"
      - "./services/api/data:/var/lib/bencher/data"
    # environment:
      # Set configuration string or file path
      # - BENCHER_CONFIG=
      # - BENCHER_CONFIG_PATH=

  bencher_console_compose:
    image: ghcr.io/bencherdev/bencher-console:latest
    container_name: bencher_console
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    environment:
      - BENCHER_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:61016
      # This is needed for Docker-to-Docker communication when using a local `BENCHER_API_URL`
      # Do not set this when using a remote `BENCHER_API_URL`, such as https://bencher.example.com
      - INTERNAL_API_URL=http://host.docker.internal:61016
    depends_on:
      - bencher_api_compose
```
