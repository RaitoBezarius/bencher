## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy Bencher Self-Hosted is using a triptych of `bencher` CLI subcommands:

- [`bencher up`][bencher up]: Bring up the Bencher Self-Hosted containers.
  This is similar to running [`docker compose up`][docker compose up].
- [`bencher logs`][bencher logs]: View output from the Bencher Self-Hosted containers,
  if `bencher up` was run with [the `--detach` flag][detach flag].
  This is similar to running [`docker compose logs`][docker compose logs].
- [`bencher down`][bencher down]: Stop and remove the Bencher Self-Hosted containers,
  if `bencher up` was run with [the `--detach` flag][detach flag].
  This is similar to running [`docker compose down`][docker compose down].

[docker compose logs]: https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/logs/
[docker compose down]: https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/down/

[bencher up]: #bencher-up
[bencher logs]: #bencher-logs
[bencher down]: #bencher-down
[detach flag]: #--detach

<div class="box">
  <BencherUp />
</div>

<div class="box">
  <BencherLogs />
</div>

<div class="box">
  <BencherDown />
</div>

Alternatively, you could just use `docker compose` to orchestrate the containers.
This is an example `docker-compose.yml` file:

<DockerCompose />
