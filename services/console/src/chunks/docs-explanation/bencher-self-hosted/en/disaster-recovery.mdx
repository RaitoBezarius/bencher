## Disaster Recovery

In order to prevent data loss in between backups,
Bencher offers a built-in disaster recovery solution.
This feature requires an active [Bencher Plus][pricing] license.

Supported replication schemes:

- `file`: Replicate to a local file path
- `sftp`: Replicate over SFTP
- `s3`: Replicate to any S3 compatible blob storage
- `abs`: Replicate to Azure Blob Storage
- `gcs`: Replicate to Google Cloud Storage

Use [the `plus.disaster_recovery` section][plus disaster recovery] of the API server configuration
to setup disaster recovery for your Bencher Self-Hosted API server.
