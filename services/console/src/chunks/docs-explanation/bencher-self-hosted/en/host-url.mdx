## Host URL

When using Bencher Self-Hosted,
you will need to set [the `--host` option][host option]
to the URL of your Bencher API server
for most `bencher` CLI subcommands.

For example, if you were using the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand
with a Bencher API server at `https://api.bencher.example.com`
then you could write something like this:

<BencherRunCode />

[host option]: /docs/explanation/bencher-run/#--host-url
