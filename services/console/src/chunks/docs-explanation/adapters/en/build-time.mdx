### ⏱️ Build Time

The <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand
can be used to track the build time (ie compile time) of your deliverables with the `--build-time` flag.
Under the hood, <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code>
outputs the results as [Bencher Metric Format (BMF) JSON][bmf].
It is therefore good practice to explicitly use [the `json` adapter][json].
For more details see [how to track build time][build time].

The `build-time` Measure (ie `seconds (s)`) is gathered.
Only the build time value (ie `value`) is available.
Neither `lower_value` nor `upper_value` are collected.
The `build-time` Measure is not created by default for all Projects.
However, when you use the `--build-time` flag, this Measure will be automatically created for your Project.
