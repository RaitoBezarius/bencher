## ♦️ Ruby Benchmark

The Ruby Benchmark Adapter (`ruby_benchmark`) expects [Benchmark module](https://github.com/ruby/benchmark) output for the `#bm`, `#bmbm`, and `#benchmark` methods.
A label is required for each benchmark.
The `latency` Measure (ie `nanoseconds (ns)`) is gathered.
Only the reported value (ie `value`) is available.
Neither `lower_value` nor `upper_value` are collected.
