### ⚖️ File Size

The <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand
can be used to track the file size (ie binary size) of your deliverables with the `--file-size` option.
The `--file-size` option expects a file path to the file who's size will be measured.
Under the hood, <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code>
outputs the results as [Bencher Metric Format (BMF) JSON][bmf].
It is therefore good practice to explicitly use [the `json` adapter][json].
For more details see [how to track file size][file size].

The `file-size` Measure (ie `bytes (B)`) is gathered.
Only the file size value (ie `value`) is available.
Neither `lower_value` nor `upper_value` are collected.
The `file-size` Measure is not created by default for all Projects.
However, when you use the `--file-size` option, this Measures will be automatically created for your Project.
The `--file-size` option can be used multiple times to track multiple file sizes.
