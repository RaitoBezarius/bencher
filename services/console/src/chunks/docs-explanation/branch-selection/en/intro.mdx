A Branch is the `git` ref (ie branch name or tag).
When using the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand,
select a Branch with the `--branch` option or the `BENCHER_BRANCH` environment variable.
The current `git` hash can also be specified with the `--hash` option.
If a Branch is not specified then the current `git` branch name is used if it is available.
Otherwise, `main` is used as the default Branch.
Similarly, if the `git` hash is not specified then the current `git` hash is used if it is available.

When [Continuous Benchmarking][continuous benchmarking], that is benchmarking in CI,
you will often want to create or rebase a `branch` on an already existing Branch.
This is called a Branch [Start Point][start point].
A Start Point is another Branch at a specific version (and `git` hash, if available).
When using the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand,
select a Start Point with the `--start-point` option.
Additionally, use the `--start-point-hash` option to specify a specific `git` hash for the Start Point.
The amount of data that is copied over from the Start Point is controlled with the `--start-point-max-versions` option.
Similarly, [Thresholds][thresholds] can be copied over from the Start Point with the `--start-point-clone-thresholds` flag.
To prevent drift, use the `--start-point-reset` flag to always reset the Branch to the Start Point.
