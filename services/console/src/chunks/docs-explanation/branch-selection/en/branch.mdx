### `--branch <BRANCH>`

<br />

To select a Branch, set the `--branch` option or the `BENCHER_BRANCH` environment variable
to the name, slug, or UUID for the Branch.
If the value specified is a name or slug and the Branch does not already exist, it will be created for you.
However, if the value specified is a UUID then the Branch must already exist.
If both are specified, the `--branch` option takes precedence over the `BENCHER_BRANCH` environment variable.

If neither are specified, the Bencher CLI tries to find the current `git` branch.
It starts by looking for a `git` repository in the current working directory.
If unsuccessful, it continues to its parent directory and retries all the way up to the root directory.
If a `git` repository is found, then the current short branch name is used.
However, if a `git` repository is not found then `main` is used as the default Branch.
