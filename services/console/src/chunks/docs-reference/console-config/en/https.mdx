## HTTPS

By default, the Bencher Console server uses HTTP.
This works well if you have a proxy server in front of it to handle HTTPS.
If you need a standalone Console server to handle HTTPS itself
then you need to provide an SSL key and certificate.

You can configure HTTPS using the following environment variables:
  - `SERVER_KEY_PATH`: The file path to your TLS key.
  - `SERVER_CERT_PATH`: The file path to your TLS certificate.
