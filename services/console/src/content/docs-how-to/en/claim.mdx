Bencher allows you to track benchmarks results without creating an account.
When you run the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand
without setting [the `--token` option][token option],
Bencher will [create an on-the-fly Project][project option]
for your benchmark results.
If you followed the [Quick Start][quick start] or [Docker Self-Hosted][docker self-hosted] tutorials,
you were taking advantage of this functionality.

A new on-the-fly Project is `unclaimed`.
Anyone can view and post benchmark results to an `unclaimed` Project.
In order to `claim` the Project, you will need to create an account.
If you follow the `Claim this project` signup link at the end of the
<code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> output,
you will automatically claim the Project when your account is created.

If you already have a Bencher account,
then you can navigate to the project's public Perf Page
and click the `Claim this project` button.
Similarly, if you also have an API token,
you can use the API token with the [the `--token` option][token option]
the next time you invoke <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code>
to claim the Project.

This great for getting started 
However, if you want to track benchmarks in a CI/CD environment,
then you will need to create an account.


There are two main places that developers track their benchmarks:

1. In their local development environment
2. In a CI/CD environment


If you have already run benchmarks locally,
then you can claim the Project that was created for you
when you used the
<code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand.
There are a few ways to claim these benchmark results:

1. Follow the `Claim this project` signup link that is at the end of the `bencher run` output
2. Sign up for a Bencher account and click the `Claim this project` button on the Project's Perf Page
3. Signup for a Bencher account, create an API token, and use the API token [the `--token` option][token option] the next time you use <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> to claim the Project

When a new Project is created for you, whether the slug is specified or generated,
the Project has to belong to an Organization.
If the user is authenticated, then the Project is added under that user's personal Organization.
If the user is not authenticated, the Project will be created under a new `unclaimed` Organization.
This Organization can then be `claimed` from the Project's public Perf Page
or by using the Project slug while authenticated in a subsequent invocation of `bencher run`.

[quick start]: /docs/tutorial/quick-start/
[docker self-hosted]: /docs/tutorial/docker/
[project option]: /docs/explanation/bencher-run/#--project-project
[token option]: /docs/explanation/bencher-run/#--token-token




Bencher allows you to create projects on-the-fly without 

Optional: Either the `--project` option or the `BENCHER_PROJECT` environment variable
may be set to the slug or UUID for a Project.
If the value specified is a slug and the Project does not already exist, it will be created for you.
However, if the value specified is a UUID then the Project must already exist.
If both are specified, the `--project` option takes precedence over the `BENCHER_PROJECT` environment variable.
If neither are specified then a Project slug will be generated for you based on:

1. The name of the parent directory for the `git` repository, if it is available.
2. A 7 digit hexadecimal short hash for the initial commit of the `git` repository, if it is available.
3. A 13 digit alphanumeric fingerprint of the local machine, for supported operating systems.

For example, a generated Project slug might look like: `project-abc4567-wxyz123456789`

When a new Project is created for you, whether the slug is specified or generated,
the Project has to belong to an Organization.
If the user is authenticated, then the Project is added under that user's personal Organization.
If the user is not authenticated, the Project will be created under a new `unclaimed` Organization.
This Organization can then be `claimed` from the Project's public Perf Page
or by using the Project slug while authenticated in a subsequent invocation of `bencher run`.
