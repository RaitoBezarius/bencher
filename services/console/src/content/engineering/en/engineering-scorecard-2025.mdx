When developing a new technology, like [Bencher][bencher],
there is a fundamental tension between wanting to [choose boring technology][choose boring technology]
and [beating the averages][beating the averages].
In the moment, it can be difficult to tell exactly where one stands in this tug-of-war.
Every three years, the Rust programming language comes out with a new [Rust edition][rust editions].
I think this is a nice cadence. It's long enough for real progress to be made.
Yet, short enough not to drift too far afield.

In this post, I'm going to review where Bencher has spent its "innovation tokens" over the past three years.
I'll start at the frontend of the [Bencher architecture][architecture] and move all the way down the stack.
At each stop along with way, I'll discuss how we got here and rate how each innovation token panned out.
