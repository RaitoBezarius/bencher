The Bencher Console UI does not require any configuration.
However, the defaults can be customized to suite your needs:

- `BENCHER_API_URL` environment variable: The URL for [the Bencher API server][server config].
  By default, this is set to `http://localhost:61016`.
- `INTERNAL_API_URL` environment variable: When using Docker based networking, such as with `docker compose`,
  this is needed for Docker-to-Docker communication when using a local `BENCHER_API_URL`.
  Do not set this when using a remote `BENCHER_API_URL`, such as `https://bencher.example.com`.
  By default, this is not set.

By default, [the Bencher API server][server config] expects the Bencher Console to be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
If your Bencher Console server is running elsewhere, then you need to set
[the `console.url` option][console url].

In order to setup HTTPS on your Console Server, you will need to:
